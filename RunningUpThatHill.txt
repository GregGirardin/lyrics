Running Up That Hill

It doesn't hurt me. Do you want to feel how it feels?
Do you want to know that it doesn't hurt me?
Do you want to hear about the deal that I'm making?
You, it's you and me.

  And if I only could I'd make a deal with God and I'd get him to swap our places
  Be running up that road, be running up that hill, be running up that building.
  If I only could oh...

You don't want to hurt me, but see how deep the bullet lies.
Unaware I'm tearing you asunder, there is thunder in our hearts.
Is there so much hate for the ones we love?
Tell me we both matter, don't we?
You, it's you and me. It's you and me won't be unhappy.

Chorus

    C'mon baby, c'mon darling, let me steal this moment from you now.
    C'mon angel, c'mon c'mon, darling, let's exchange the experience, oh
