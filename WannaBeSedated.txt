I Wanna Be Sedated

Twenty twenty twenty four hours to go I wanna be sedated
Nothing to do, no where to go o, I wanna be sedated
1) Just get me to the airport, put me on a plane
2) Just put me in a wheelchair, get me on a plane
3) Just put me in a wheelchair, get me to the show
Hurry hurry hurry, before I go insane (3. loco)
I can't control my fingers, I can't control my brain oh no..

Ba ba baba, baba ba baba, I wanna be sedated
