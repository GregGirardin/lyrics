Bullet Proof

V: Am CM7 Bm D
C: (G Bm C9) Gm/Bb

Limb by limb and tooth by tooth tearing up inside of me
Everyday every hour wish that I was bullet proof

Wax me, mould me, heat the pins and stab them in
you have turned me into this just wish that it was bullet proof

  Bullet proof

So pay me money and take a shot lead-fill the hole in me
i could burst a million bubbles all surrogate and bullet proof

  Bullet proof
