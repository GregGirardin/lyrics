Dragula
 
C F
B: Bb F

Dead I am the one exterminating son, slipping through the trees, strangling the breeze
Dead I am the sky watching angels cry, while they slowly turn, conquering the worm.

  Dig through the ditches and burn through the witches
  I slam in the back of my Dragula!

Dead I am the pool spreading from the fool, weak and what you need, nowhere as you bleed
Dead I am the rat feast upon the cat, tender is the fur, dying as you purr.
 
Chorus
 
    Do it baby, do it baby
 
Dead I am the life dig into the skin, knuckle crack the bone twenty one to win
Dead I am the dog hound of hell you cry, devil on your back I can never die.
 
Chorus
