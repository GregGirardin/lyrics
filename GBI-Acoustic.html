&nbsp&nbspNo, woman, no cry...<br>
<br>
Cause, I remember when we used to sit in the government yard in Trenchtown<br>
Observing the hypocrites mingle with the good people we meet<br>
Good friends we have, oh, good friends we've lost along the way<br>
In this great future, you can't forget your past so dry your tears, I say<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspNo, woman, no cry. Little darlin', don't shed no tears<br>
<br>
Said, I remember when we used to sit in the government yard in Trenchtown.<br>
And then Georgie would make the fire light log wood burnin through the night<br>
Then we would cook cornmeal porridge of which I'll share with you<br>
My feet is my only carriage so I've got to push on through, but while I'm gone<br>

Sometimes in our lives we all have pain we all have sorrow<br>
But if we are wise we know that there's always tomorrow<br>

&nbsp&nbspLean on me, when you're not strong and I'll be your friend I'll help you carry on<br>
&nbsp&nbspFor it won't be long 'til I'm gonna need somebody to lean on<br>
<br>
Please swallow your pride if I have things you need to borrow<br>
For no one can fill those of your needs that you won't let show<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSo just call on me brother, when you need a hand<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe all need somebody to lean on<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI just might have a problem that you'd understand<br>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSo just call on me brother, when you need a hand...<br>

If there is a load you have to bear that you can't carry<br>
I'm right up the road, I'll share your load if you just call me<br>

&nbsp&nbspLife is very short and there's no time for fussing and fighting my friend<br>

White lace and feathers they made up his bed<br>
A gold covered mattress on which he was laid<br>

He went to fight wars for his country and his king<br>
Of his honor and his glory the people would sing<br>

A bullet had found him his blood ran as he cried<br>
No money could save him so he laid down and he died<br>

After three days in the desert fun I was looking at a river bed<br>
And the story it told of a river that flowed made me sad to think it was dead<br>

After nine days I let the horse run free cause the desert had turned to sea<br>
There were plants and birds and rocks and things there were sand and hills and rings<br>

To open up my heart to all that jealousy that bitterness, that ridicule<br>

Saturday I'm running wild and all the lights are changing red to green<br>
Moving through the crowd I'm pushing chemicals all rushing in my bloodstream<br>

To show you how I really feel admit to some of those bad mistakes I've made<br>

She showed me her room, isn't it good Norwegian wood<br>
She asked my to stay and told me to sit anywhere<br>

I sat on a rug, biding my time, drinking her wine<br>
We talked until two, and then she said, it's time for bed<br>
She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh<br>
I told her I didn't, and crawled off to sleep in the bath<br>

Come a little bit closer hear what I have to say<br>
Just like children sleeping we could dream this night away<br>
But there's a full moon rising let's go dancing in the light<br>
We know where the music's playing let's go out and feel the night.<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspBecause I'm still in love with you, I want to see you dance again<br>
&nbsp&nbspBecause I'm still in love with you, on this harvest moon.<br>
<br>
When we were strangers I watched you from afar<br>
When we were lovers I loved you with all my heart.<br>
But now its gettin late and the moon is climbing high<br>
I want to celebrate see it shining in your eye.<br>

<br>
Early in the morning, risin' to the street<br>
Light me up that cigarette and I strap shoes on my feet<br>
Got to find a reason, a reason things went wrong<br>
Got to find a reason why my money's all gone<br>
I got a dalmatian, and I can still get high<br>
I can play the guitar like a motherfucking riot<br>
<br>
Well, life is too short, so love the one you got<br>
Cause you might get run over or you might get shot<br>
Never start no static I just get it off my chest<br>
Never had to battle with no bulletproof vest<br>
Take a small example, take a tip from me<br>
Take all of your money, give it all to charity<br>
<br>
Love is what I got, it's within my reach<br>
And the Sublime style's still straight from Long Beach<br>
It all comes back to you you'll finally get what you deserve<br>
Try and test that you're bound to get served<br>
Love's what I got don't start a riot<br>
You'll feel it when the dance gets hot<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspLovin', is what I got, I said remember that<br>
<br>
Why I don't cry when my dog runs away<br>
I don't get angry at the bills I have to pay<br>
I don't get angry when my mom smokes pot<br>
Hits the bottle and goes right to the rock<br>
Fuckin' and fightin it's all the same<br>
Livin' with Louie dog's the only way to stay sane<br>
Let the lovin' come back to me<br>

We touch, this place is so quiet, sensing that storm<br>
<br>
Well I've seen them buried in a sheltered place in this town<br>
They tell you that this rain can sting, and look down<br>
There is no blood around see no sign of pain<br>
No pain, seeing no red at all, see no rain<br>

&nbsp&nbspJust let the red rain splash you, let the rain fall on your skin<br>

<br>
On a warm summer's evenin' on a train bound for nowhere,<br>
I met up with the gambler; we were both too tired to sleep.<br>
So we took turns a starin' out the window at the darkness<br>
'til boredom overtook us, and he began to speak.<br>
<br>
He said, "Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces,<br>
and knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes.<br>
And if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces.<br>
For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice."<br>
<br>
So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow.<br>
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light.<br>
And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression.<br>
Said, "If you're gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right.<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspYou got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em,<br>
&nbsp&nbspknow when to walk away and know when to run.<br>
&nbsp&nbspYou never count your money when you're sittin' at the table.<br>
&nbsp&nbspThere'll be time enough for countin when the dealin's done.<br>
<br>
Ev'ry gambler knows that the secret to survivin<br>
is knowin what to throw away and knowing what to keep.<br>
cause every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser,<br>
and the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep.<br>
<br>
And when he'd finished speakin', he turned back towards the window,<br>
crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep.<br>
And somewhere in the darkness the gambler, he broke even.<br>
But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep.<br>

As the music dies, something in your eyes<br>
Calls to mind a silver screen and all its sad goodbyes<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspI'm never gonna dance again, guilty feet have got no rhythm<br>
&nbsp&nbspThough it's easy to pretend I know your not a fool<br>
&nbsp&nbspShould've known better than to cheat a friend and waste the chance that I've been given<br>
&nbsp&nbspSo I'm never gonna dance again the way I danced with you<br>
<br>
Time can never mend the careless whispers of a good friend<br>
To the heart and mind ignorance is kind<br>
There's no comfort in the truth pain is all you'll find<br>
<br>
Tonight the music seems so loud I wish that we could lose this crowd<br>
Maybe it's better this way we'd hurt each other with the things we'd want to say<br>
We could have been so good together we could have lived this dance forever<br>

When you see the Southern Cross for the first time you understand now why you came this way<br>
'Cause the truth you might be runnin from is so small but it's as big as the promise, the promise of a coming day<br>
So I'm sailing for tomorrow, my dreams are a dyin and my love is an anchor tied to you, tied with a silver chain<br>

If there's one thing in my life that's missing it's the time that I spend alone<br>
Sailing on the cool and bright clear water<br>
There's lots of those friendly people they're showing me ways to go<br>
But I never want to lose their inspiration<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspTime for cool change, I know that it's time for a cool change<br>
&nbsp&nbspAnd now that my life is so prearranged..<br>
<br>
Well I was born in the sign of water and it's there that I feel my best<br>
The albatross and the whales they are my brothers<br>
It's kind of a special feeling when you're out on the sea alone<br>
Staring at the full moon like a lover<br>

We'll do it all, everything, on our own.<br>
We don't need anything, or anyone.<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspIf I lay here, if I just lay here,<br>
&nbsp&nbspWould you lie with me, and just forget the world.<br>
<br>
I don't quite know how to say how I feel<br>
Those three words, I said too much, but not enough.<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspIf I lay here..<br>
&nbsp&nbspForget what we're told, before we get too old<br>
&nbsp&nbspShow me a garden that's bursting into life.<br>
<br>
Let's waste time, chasing cars, around our heads<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspIf I lay here...<br>
&nbsp&nbspAll that I am, all that I ever was<br>
&nbsp&nbspIs here in your perfect eyes, they're all I can see<br>

&nbsp&nbspjust know that these things will never change for us at all.<br>

A green plastic watering can for a fake Chinese rubber plant in the fake plastic earth<br>
That she bought from a rubber man in a town full of rubber plans to get rid of itself<br>
&nbsp&nbspIt wears her out<br>
<br>
She lives with a broken man a cracked polystyrene man who just crumbles and burns<br>
He used to do surgery for girls in the eighties but gravity always wins<br>
&nbsp&nbspAnd it wears him out<br>
<br>
She looks like the real thing she tastes like the real thing my fake plastic love<br>
But I can't help the feeling I could blow through the ceiling if I just turn and run<br>
&nbsp&nbspAnd it wears me out<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspAnd if I could be who you wanted, all the time<br>

And you'd be right in guessin that each and every lesson they were hard won<br>

Ran into the devil, babe, he loaned me twenty bills<br>
I spent the night in Utah in a cave up in the hills<br>

I ran down to the levee but the devil caught me there<br>
He took my twenty dollar bill and vanished in the air<br>

&nbsp&nbspGot two reasons why I cry away each lonely night<br>
&nbsp&nbspThe first one's named Sweet Anne Marie and she's my hearts delight<br>
&nbsp&nbspThe second one is prison, babe the sheriff's on my trail<br>

So, so you think you can tell, heaven from hell, blue skies from pain<br>
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail, a smile from a veil<br>
Do you think you can tell?<br>

Did they get you to trade, your heroes for ghosts hot ashes for trees<br>
Hot air for a cool breeze, cold comfort for change<br>
And did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage<br>
<br>
How I wish, how I wish you were here<br>
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year<br>
Running over the same old ground what have we found<br>
the same old fears. Wish you were here<br>

would you hold it near as it were your own<br>

I don't know, don't really care<br>
let there be songs to fill the air<br>

&nbsp&nbspRipple in still water when there is no pebble tossed nor wind to blow<br>
<br>
Reach out your hand if your cup be empty<br>
If your cup is full may it be again<br>
let it be known there is a fountain<br>
that was not made by the hands of men<br>
<br>
There is a road, no simple highway<br>
Between the dawn and the dark of night<br>
and if you go no one may follow<br>
that path is for your steps alone.<br>

&nbsp&nbspRipple in still water...<br>

You who choose to lead must follow<br>
But if you fall you fall alone<br>
If you should stand then who's to guide you<br>
