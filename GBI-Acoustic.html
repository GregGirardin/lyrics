Cause, I remember when we used to sit in the government yard in Trenchtown<br>
Observing the hypocrites mingle with the good people we meet<br>
Good friends we have, oh, good friends we've lost along the way<br>

<br>
&nbsp&nbspNo, woman, no cry. Little darlin', don't shed no tears<br>

Said, I remember when we used to sit in the government yard in Trenchtown.<br>
And then Georgie would make the fire light log wood burnin through the night<br>
Then we would cook cornmeal porridge of which I'll share with you<br>
My feet is my only carriage so I've got to push on through, but while I'm gone<br>

But if we are wise we know that there's always tomorrow<br>

For no one can fill those of your needs that you won't let show<br>

Try to see it my way. Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on<br>
While you see it your way, run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone<br>
We can work it out<br>
<br>
Think of what you're saying. You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright<br>
Think of what I'm saying. We can work it out and get it straight or say goodnight<br>
We can work it out<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspLife is very short and there's no time for fussing and fighting my friend<br>
&nbsp&nbspI have always thought that it's a crime so I will ask you once again<br>

Try to see it my way only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong<br>
While you see it your way there's a chance that we might fall apart before too long<br>
We can work it out<br>

All dressed in satin and waiting by the door<br>

White lace and feathers they made up his bed<br>
A gold covered mattress on which he was laid<br>

He went to fight wars for his country and his king<br>
Of his honor and his glory the people would sing<br>

A bullet had found him his blood ran as he cried<br>
No money could save him so he laid down and he died<br>

If the night turned cold and the stars looked down<br>
And you hug yourself on the cold cold ground<br>
you wake the morning in a stranger's coat no one would you see<br>
You ask yourself, who'd watch for me my only friend, who could it be<br>
It's hard to say it I hate to say it, but it's probably me<br>
<br>
When your belly's empty and the hunger's so real<br>
and you're too proud to beg and too dumb to steal<br>
you search the city for your only friend no one would you see<br>
Ask yourself, who'd watch for me a solitary voice to speak out and set me free...<br>

&nbsp&nbspYou're not the easiest person I ever got to know<br>
&nbsp&nbspAnd it's hard for us both to let our feelings show<br>

&nbsp&nbspin the desert you can remember your name<br>
&nbsp&nbsp'cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain La la<br>

After two days in the desert sun my skin began to turn red<br>
After three days in the desert fun I was looking at a river bed<br>
And the story it told of a river that flowed made me sad to think it was dead<br>
<br>
After nine days I let the horse run free cause the desert had turned to sea<br>
There were plants and birds and rocks and things there were sand and hills and rings<br>
The ocean is a desert with it's life underground and the perfect disguise above<br>
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground but the humans will give no love<br>

&nbsp&nbspTime for cool change, I know that it's time for a cool change<br>
&nbsp&nbspAnd now that my life is so prearranged..<br>
<br>
Well I was born in the sign of water and it's there that I feel my best<br>
The albatross and the whales they are my brothers<br>
It's kind of a special feeling when you're out on the sea alone<br>
Staring at the full moon like a lover<br>
<br>

Got out of town on a boat goin to southern islands sailing a reach before a followin sea<br>
She was makin for the trades on the outside and the downhill run to Papeete Bay<br>
Off the wind on this heading lie the Marquesas we got eighty feet of the waterline, nicely making way<br>
In a noisy bar in Avalon I tried to call you but on a midnight watch I realized why twice you ran away<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThink about how many times I have fallen<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSpirits are using me, larger voices callin<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWhat heaven brought you and me cannot be forgotten<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI have been around the world lookin' for that woman, girl<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWho knows love can endure and you know it will and you know it will<br>
<br>
When you see the Southern Cross for the first time you understand now why you came this way<br>
'Cause the truth you might be runnin from is so small but it's as big as the promise, the promise of a coming day<br>
So I'm sailing for tomorrow, my dreams are a dyin and my love is an anchor tied to you, tied with a silver chain<br>
I have my ship and all her flags are a flyin she is all that I have left and music is her name<br>
<br>
<b>- Chorus -</b><br>
<br>
So we cheated and we lied and we tested and we never failed to fail, it was the easiest thing to do<br>
You will survive being bested but somebody fine will come along make me forget about loving you<br>

Friday night I'm going nowhere all the lights are changing green to red<br>
Turning over TV stations situations running through my head<br>
Looking back through time you know it's clear that I've been blind I've been a fool<br>
To open up my heart to all that jealousy that bitterness, that ridicule<br>
<br>
Saturday I'm running wild and all the lights are changing red to green<br>
Moving through the crowd I'm pushing chemicals all rushing in my bloodstream<br>
Only wish that you were here you know I'm seeing it so clear I've been afraid<br>
To show you how I really feel admit to some of those bad mistakes I've made<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspIf you want it come and get it crying out loud<br>
&nbsp&nbspThe love that I was giving you was never in doubt<br>
&nbsp&nbspLet go of your heart let go of your head and feel it now (x 2)<br>

Sunday all the lights of London shining sky is fading red to blue<br>
Kicking through the autumn leaves and wondering where it is you might be going to<br>
Turning back for home you know I'm feeling so alone I can't believe<br>
Climbing on the stair I turn around to see you smiling there in front of me<br>

I sat on a rug, biding my time, drinking her wine<br>
We talked until two, and then she said, it's time for bed<br>

&nbsp&nbspI told her I didn't, and crawled off to sleep in the bath<br>

Early in the morning, risin' to the street<br>
Light me up that cigarette and I strap shoes on my feet<br>
Got to find a reason, a reason things went wrong<br>
Got to find a reason why my money's all gone<br>
I got a dalmatian, and I can still get high<br>
I can play the guitar like a motherfucking riot<br>
<br>
Well, life is too short, so love the one you got<br>
Cause you might get run over or you might get shot<br>
Never start no static I just get it off my chest<br>
Never had to battle with no bulletproof vest<br>
Take a small example, take a tip from me<br>
Take all of your money, give it all to charity<br>

Love is what I got, it's within my reach<br>
And the Sublime style's still straight from Long Beach<br>
It all comes back to you you'll finally get what you deserve<br>

On a warm summer's evenin' on a train bound for nowhere,<br>
I met up with the gambler; we were both too tired to sleep.<br>
So we took turns a starin' out the window at the darkness<br>
'til boredom overtook us, and he began to speak.<br>
<br>
He said, "Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces,<br>
and knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes.<br>
And if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces.<br>
For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice."<br>
<br>
So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow.<br>
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light.<br>
And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression.<br>
Said, "If you're gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right.<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspYou got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em,<br>
&nbsp&nbspknow when to walk away and know when to run.<br>
&nbsp&nbspYou never count your money when you're sittin' at the table.<br>
&nbsp&nbspThere'll be time enough for countin when the dealin's done.<br>
<br>
Ev'ry gambler knows that the secret to survivin<br>
is knowin what to throw away and knowing what to keep.<br>
cause every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser,<br>
and the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep.<br>
<br>
And when he'd finished speakin', he turned back towards the window,<br>
crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep.<br>
And somewhere in the darkness the gambler, he broke even.<br>
But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep.<br>

&nbsp&nbspCan I come home for the summer I could slow down for a little while<br>

Through the years I have learned some things worth the tellin<br>
And you'd be right in guessin that each and every lesson they were hard won<br>

So, so you think you can tell, heaven from hell, blue skies from pain<br>
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail, a smile from a veil<br>
Do you think you can tell?<br>
<br>
Did they get you to trade, your heroes for ghosts hot ashes for trees<br>
Hot air for a cool breeze, cold comfort for change<br>
And did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage<br>
<br>
How I wish, how I wish you were here<br>
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year<br>
Running over the same old ground what have we found<br>
the same old fears. Wish you were here<br>

If my words did glow with the gold of sunshine<br>
and my tunes were played on the harp unstrung<br>
would you hear my voice come through the music<br>
would you hold it near as it were your own<br>
<br>

perhaps they're better left unsung<br>
I don't know, don't really care<br>
let there be songs to fill the air<br>

&nbsp&nbspRipple in still water when there is no pebble tossed nor wind to blow<br>
<br>
Reach out your hand if your cup be empty<br>
If your cup is full may it be again<br>
let it be known there is a fountain<br>
that was not made by the hands of men<br>
<br>
There is a road, no simple highway<br>
Between the dawn and the dark of night<br>
and if you go no one may follow<br>
that path is for your steps alone.<br>
