I'm only pretty sure that I can't take anymore, before you
take a swing, I wonder what are we fighting
for? When I say out loud, I want to get out of this
I wonder, is there anything I'm gonna miss?
 
  I wonder how it's gonna be when you don't know me?
  How's it gonna be when you're sure I'm not there?
  How's it gonna be when there's no one there to talk to?
  Between you and me, cause I don't care, how's it gonna be?
 
Where we used to laugh, there's a shouting match. Sharp as a thumbnail
scratch. silence I can't ignore hammock by the doorway
we spent time in, swing's empty I don't see lightning like last fall,
when it was always about to hit me
 
  I wonder
  How's it gonna be, when it goes down?
  How's it gonna be, when you're not around?
  How's it gonna be, when you found out there was nothing
  between you and me, cause I don't care, how's it gonna be.
    
    How's it gonna be when you don't know me anymore
    How's it gonna be
    Wanna get myself back in again. The soft dive of oblivion
    I wanna taste the salt of your skin. The soft dive of oblivion..
    How's it gonna be when you don't know me anymore
    How's it gonna be

How's it gonna be..
