How It Gonna Be

I'm only pretty sure that I can't take anymore, before you
take a swing, I wonder what are we fighting
for? When I say out loud, "I want to get out of this"
I wonder, is there anything I'm gonna miss?
 
  I wonder [how it's gonna be] when you don't know me?
  HIGB when you're sure I'm not there?
  HIGB when there's no one there to talk to?
  Between you and me, cause I don't care, how's it gonna be?
 
Where we used to laugh, there's a shouting match. Sharp as a thumbnail
scratch. Silence I can't ignore hammock by the doorway
we spent time in, swing's empty I don't see lightning like last fall,
when it was always about to hit me.
 
  I wonder
  HIGB when it goes down?
  HIGB when you're not around?
  HIGB when you found out there was nothing
  between you and me, cause I don't care, how's it gonna be.
    
    HIGB when you don't know me anymore, HIGB
      Wanna get myself back in again. The soft dive of oblivion
      I wanna taste the salt of your skin. The soft dive of oblivion..
    HHIGB when you don't know me anymore, HIGB
