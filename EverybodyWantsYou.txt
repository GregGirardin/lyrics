Everybody Wants You

You see em comin at you every night strung on pretension, they fall for you at first sight
You know their business, you think it's a bore, they make you restless it's nothin' you ain't seen before

  Get around town, spend your time on the run
  You never let down, say you do it for fun
  Never miss a play, though you make quite a few
  You give it all away - everybody wants you

You crave attention, you can never say "no" throw your affections any way the wind blows
You always make it you're on top of the scene you sell the copy like the cover of a magazine

  Puttin on the eyes til there's nobody else
  You never realize what you do to yourself
  The things that they see make the daily reviews
  You never get free - everybody wants you

    Everybody knows you everybody snows you
    Everybody leads you, needs you, bleeds you

Solo

Nights of confusion and impossible dreams days at the mirror patchin' up around the seams
You got your glory, you paid for it all you take your pension in loneliness and alcohol

  Say goodbye to conventional ways
  You can't escape the hours, you lose track of the days
  The more you understand seems the more like you do
  You never get away... everybody wants you
