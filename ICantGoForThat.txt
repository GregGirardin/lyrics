Easy, ready, willing, overtime
Where does it stop, where do you dare me to draw the line
You've got the body, now you want my soul
Don't even think about it, say no go.

  I'll do anything that you want me to do,
  And I'll do almost anything, that you want me too
  But I can't go for that, (No can do)

I can't go for being twice as nice
I can't go for just repeating the same old lives
Use the body now you want my soul
Do forget about it say no go.

Chorus
