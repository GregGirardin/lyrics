Black Horse and the Cherry Tree

V: Em B7 Em
C: Em D C 

Woo-hoo,woo-hoo
 
Well my heart knows me better than I know myself so I'm gonna let it do all the talking.
I came across a place in the middle of nowhere with a big black horse and a cherry tree.
I felt a little fear upon my back I said "Don't look back, just keep on walking.
When the big black horse said, "Look this way" He said, "Hey there baby, will you marry me?"
 
  But I said no... I said, no, no, you're not the one for me
 
And my heart hit a problem, in the early hours, so I stopped it dead for a beat or two.
But I cut some cord, and I shouldn't have done it, and it won't forgive me after all these years
So I sent it to a place in the middle of nowhere with a big black horse and a cherry tree.
Now it won't come back, cause it's oh so happy and now I've got a hole for the world to see
 
Chorus
 
  Big black horse and a cherry tree
  I can't quite get there 'cause my heart's forsaken me
