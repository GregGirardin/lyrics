Daisy Jane

Flyin' me back to Memphis gotta find my Daisy Jane
Well, the summer's gone and I hope she's feelin' the same.
Well, I left her just to roam the city thinkin' it would ease the pain
I'm a crazy man and I'm playin' my crazy game, game...

  Does she really love me I think she does
  Like the stars above me I know because
  When the sky is bright everything's alright.

Flyin' me back to Memphis honey, keep the oven warm
All the clouds are clearin and I think we're over the storm.
Well, I've been pickin' it up around me Daisy, I think I'm insane
Well, I'm awful glad and I guess you're really to blame, blame...

  Do you really love me I hope you do
  Like the stars above me how I love you
  When it's cold at night everything's alright.

  Does she really love me I think she does
  Like the stars above me I know because
  When the sky is bright everything's alright.
