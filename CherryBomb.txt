Cherry Bomb

Well, I lived on the outskirts of town in an eight room farm-house, baby
When my brothers and friends were around there was always something doin
Had me a couple of real nice girlfriends stopped by to see me once in a while
When I think back a-bout those days all I can do is sit and smile

  That’s when a sport was a sport and groovin’ was groovin
  And dancin’ meant everything we were young and we were improvin
  Laughin, laughin, with our friends holdin hands meant something baby
  Outside the club Cherry Bomb, our hearts were really thumpin
  Say yeah, yeah, yeah

The winter days they last forever but the weekends went by so quick
Went ridin around this little country town we were goin nuts girl out in the sticks
One night, me with my big mouth a couple guys had to put me in my place
When I see those guys these days we just laugh and say, Do you remember when?

Chorus

Now, 17 has turned 35 I’m surprised that we’re still livin
If we’ve done any wrong I hope that we’re forgiven
Got a few kids of my own and some days I still don’t know what to do
I hope that they’re not laughin too loud when they hear me talkin like this to you

Chorus
