A E - A B

Just a small town girl, living in a lonely world
She took the midnight train going anywhere
Just a city boy, born and raised in south Detroit
He took the midnight train going anywhere

A singer in a smoky room, a smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile they can share the night, it goes on and on and on and on

  Strangers waiting up and down the boulevard
  Their shadows searching in the night
  Streetlight, people, living just to find emotion
  Hiding, somewhere in the night

Working hard to get my fill, everybody wants a thrill
Paying anything to roll the dice, just one more time
Some will win, some will lose, some were born to sing the blues
Oh, the movie never ends; it goes on and on and on and on

  Strangers waiting up and down the boulevard
  Their shadows searching in the night
  Streetlight, people, living just to find emotion
  Hiding, somewhere in the night

Don't stop believing hold on to the feeling. Streetlight people
