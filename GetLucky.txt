Get lucky

Bm7, D, F#m7, E

| Am | C | Em | D |

Like the legend of the phoenix all ends with beginnings
What keeps the planet spinning the force from the beginning

  We've come too far to give up who we are
  So let's raise the bar and our cups to the stars

  She's up all night till the sun I'm up all night to get some
  She's up all night for good fun I'm up all night to get lucky
  We're up all night till the sun we're up all night to get some
  We're up all night for good fun we're up all night to get lucky

The present has no ribbon your gift keeps on giving
What is this I'm feeling? If you want to leave, I'm with it

Chorus
