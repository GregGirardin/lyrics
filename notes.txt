Mental State (day/evening)
----------------------------------
----------------------------------
  Mental issues:
    Lack of mental focus
    Lowgrade depression / lack of enjoyment
    Lowgrade anxiety.
    Hard to stay on task.
    Poor problem solving
    Balance is off a bit, feel like I "sway"

  Tends to be an issue in the morning but not so much in the evening. The difference is subtle but
  noticeable. (Zoloft withdrawal? Digestion/Diet?)

  Sleep hasn't been a problem for over a month as of 10/25. 8+ hrs a night only wake up once or twice.

  Had been taking 25mg Zoloft last few months, will go back up to 50. Also mutli-vitamin / 10mg Lisinopril.
  It's recommended to change Z in 25mg increments once/week. 50mg worked well for me for a couple years.

  Physically I feel very good, only mild normal soreness from outside work.
  Digestion isn't very good, no aches though. That could be a psychological factor.

  10/23: 4/4 (had 3 strong coffees previous days)
  -- no more strong coffees --
  10/24: 5/5+ (had 2 weak coffees, ~ 35mg Zoloft, felt really good in the evening)
  10/25: 4+/4 (2 / 50mg Z)
  10/26: 4+/5 (2 / 50mg) Felt really good in the evening.
  10/27: 4+/4+(2 / 50mg) Felt good in the am, slightly off around noon.. lunch at 1:30, ok but not perfect after
  * let's reduce then eliminate caffiene. I often feel off during the day and better at night which correllates.
  10/28: 4+/5 (1.5 cof, 37.5mg Z.) Feel ok in the AM, better in the evening
  10/29: 4+/  (2 / 50mg Z)
  10/30: 5/5  (2 / 50mg)
  10/31: 5/5  (2 / 50mg)
  11/ 1: 5/5  (2 / 50mg)
   Mood has been consistent for a while. I feel pretty good. Will stick at 50mg Z for a bit.
  11/ 2: 5/   (2 / 50mg)

  11/9: 5 # been mostly 4.5-5.5.. taking 37.5-50mg Z/day. 2 coffees.
  11/17 # same, generally feel a little down/anxious in the AM but pretty good at night.
          Mental focus is pretty good / normal. Feel worse w/o exercise so need 1-2 hrs.
          Even moderate alcohol seems to affect sleep and mood negatively the next day.
  11/23: Mental state has been better lately.
