Bad

If you twist and turn away if you tear yourself in two again
If I could, you know I would if I could, I would let it go
Surrender dislocate

If I could throw this lifeless lifeline to the wind
Leave this heart of clay, see you break, break away
Into the night through the rain
To the halflight and through the flame

If I could through myself set your spirit free
I'd lead your heart away see you break, break away
Into the light to the day

hoo hoo

  So let it go and so fade away...
  Wide awake, I'm wide awake I'm not sleeping

If they should ask then maybe they'd tell you what I would say
True colors fly in blue and black bruised silken sky and burning flag
Colors crash, collide in blood shot eyes
If I could you know I would if I could I would let it go

This desperation, separation, condemnation, revelation
in temptation, isolation, desolation, isolation

  Let it go and so fade away..
  I fade away...
  Wide awake, I'm wide awake... I'm not sleeping
