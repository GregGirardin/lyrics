Tainted Love

Sometimes I feel I've got to run away I've got to get away
From the pain you drive into the heart of me
The love we share seems to go nowhere and I've lost my light
For I toss and turn I can't sleep at night

  Once I ran to you now I'll run from you
  This tainted love you've given
  I give you all a boy could give you
  Take my tears and that's not nearly all
  Oh, tainted love, tainted love

Now, I know I've got to run away, I've got to get away
You don't really want any more from me
To make things right tou need someone to hold you tight
And you think love is to pray but I'm sorry, I don't pray that way

Chorus

Don't touch me please I cannot stand the way you tease
I love you, though you hurt me so Now, I'm gonna pack my things and go
Tainted love, oh
Touch me, baby, tainted love
Tainted love
