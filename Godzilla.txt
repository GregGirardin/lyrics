Godzilla

V: F# A
C: E F#

With a purposeful grimace and a terrible sound
He pulls the spitting high tension wires down
Helpless people on a subway train
Scream bug-eyed as he looks in on them
He picks up a bus and he throws it back down
As he wades through the buildings toward the center of town

  Oh no, they say heâ€™s got to go! Godzilla
  Oh no, there goes Tokyo Go! Go! Godzilla

History shows again and again how nature points out the folly of man. Godzilla
