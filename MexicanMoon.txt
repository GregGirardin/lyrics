Mexican Moon

Oh amigo, here we do things slow
Money, art, a broken heart, where did you want to go?
Senor, Por favor. To the hotel Zona Rosa what did I come here for?
Oh senor. I run but the damage has been done
miles have gone away and my amore he never come

  I look up at the sky I am tired and dry Uno tecate and lime
  Thinking of you underneath the Mexican moonlight...

Senor, you are wise I can see a million years, a million tears behind your eyes
Take me home. Take me to the Zona Rosa mariachis and tequila, I will dance the night alone
Just some time, hust a little kiss of mine take me where I can forget, senor you are so very kind

  I look up at the sky I am tired and dry dos tecate and lime
  Thinking of you...

  I look up at the sky...
