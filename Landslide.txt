Landslide

V: D A/C# Bm A/C#
C: A E/G# F#m - D A/C# Bm E/G#

I took my love and I took it down
I climbed a mountain and I turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snow covered hills
Until the landslide brought me down

Oh mirror in the sky what is love
Can the child within my heart rise above
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides
Can I handle the seasons of my life.. mmm...
  
  Well, I've been afraid of changing cause I built my life around you
  But time makes you bolder even children get older and I'm getting older too
 
!Solo

!Chorus

Ah, ah, take my love, take it down
Ah, ah, climb a mountain and you turn around
And if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills
Will the landslide bring you down?
