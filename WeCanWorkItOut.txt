We Can Work It Out

V: ( C Bb C ) F C F G
B: Am /G /F E7sus4

Try to see it my way. Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on
While you see it your way, run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone
We can work it out

Think of what you're saying. You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright
Think of what I'm saying. We can work it out and get it straight or say goodnight
We can work it out

  Life is very short and there's no time for fussing and fighting my friend
  I have always thought that it's a crime so I will ask you once again

Try to see it my way only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
While you see it your way there's a chance that we might fall apart before too long
We can work it out

  Life is very short...
