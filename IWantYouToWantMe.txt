I want you to want me I need you to need me
I'd love you to love me I'm beggin' you to beg me
I want you to want me I need you to need me
I'd love you to love me

  I'd shine up my old brown shoes I'd put on a brand new shirt
  I'd get home early from work If you'd say that you love me

  Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin'
  Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin'
  Feelin' all alone without a friend you know you feel like dyin'
  Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin'

I want you to want me I need you to need me
I'd love you to love me I'm beggin' you to beg me

Chorus

[Solo]

  Feelin' all alone without a friend you know you feel like dyin'
  Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin'


I want you to want me I need you to need me
I'd love you to love me I'm beggin' you to beg me
