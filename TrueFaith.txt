I feel so extraordinary something's got a hold on me
I get this feeling I'm in motion A sudden sense of liberty
I don't care 'cause I'm not there and I don't care if I'm here tomorrow
Again and again I've taken too much of all the things that cost you too much

  I used to think that the day would never come I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun
  My morning sun is the drug that brings me near to the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
  I used to think that the day would never come yhat my life would depend on the morning sun

When I was a very small boy, very small boys talked to me
Now that we've grown up together they're afraid of what they see
That's the price that we all pay and the value of destiny comes to nothing
I can't tell you where we're going I guess there was just no way of knowing

!Chorus

I feel so extraordinary something's got a hold on me
I get this feeling I'm in motion a sudden sense of liberty
The chances are we've gone too far you took my time and you took my money
Now I fear you've left me standing in a world that's so demanding

!Chorus
