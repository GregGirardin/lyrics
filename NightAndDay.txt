Night and Day

Night and day you are the one
Only you beneath the moon or under the sun
Whether near to me or far it's no matter darling where you are
I think of you day and night

Night and day why is it so
That this longing for you follows wherever I go
In the roaring traffic's boom in the silence of my lonely room
I think of you day and night

  Night and day under the hide of me
  There's an oh such a hungry yearning burning inside of me
  And this torment won't be through
  Until you let me spend my life making love to you day and night
