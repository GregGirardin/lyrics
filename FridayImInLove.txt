Friday I'm In Love

V: D G D A  Bm G D A

I don't care if Monday's blue Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too
Thursday I don't care about you it's Friday I'm in love
 
Monday you can fall apart Tuesday Wednesday break my heart
Thursday doesn't even start it's Friday I'm in love
 
  Saturday wait and Sunday always comes too late
  But Friday never hesitate...
 
I don't care if Mondays black Tuesday Wednesday heart attack
Thursday never looking back It's Friday I'm in love
 
Monday you can hold your head Tuesday Wednesday stay in bed
Or Thursday watch the walls instead it's Friday I'm in love
 
  Saturday wait..
 
    Dressed up to the eyes, it's a wonderful surprise
    To see your shoes and your spirits rise
    Throwing out your frown and just smiling at the sound
    And as sleek as a shriek spinning round and round
    Always take a big bite, it's such a gorgeous sight
    To see you eat in the middle of the night
    You can never get enough, enough of this stuff
    It's Friday I'm in love
