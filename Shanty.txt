Shanty

Gonna sit down in the kitchen and fix me something good to eat
Make my head a little high and make the whole day complete
Cuz we gonna lay around the shanty mama and put a good buzz on

Well pass it to me baby, well pass it to me slow
We'll take time out to smile a little before we let it go

Well there ain't nothin to do and there's always room for more
Fill it, light it, shut up and close the door...

We gonna sit around the kitchen fix us somethin good to eat
Make ourselves a little high and make the whole day complete
Cuz we gonna lay around the shanty mama and put a good buzz on
  Every night and day if I can help it
