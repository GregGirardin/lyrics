While the music played you worked by candle light
Those San Francisco nights, you were the best in town
Just by chance you crossed a diamond with a pearl
You turned it on the world, that's when you turned the world around
Did you feel like Jesus? Did you realise
That you were a champion in their eyes?

On the hill the stuff was laced with kerosene
But yours was kitchen clean. Everyone stopped to stare at your technicolour motorhome
Every A-frame had your number on the wall
You must have had it all. You'd go to LA on a dare and you'd go it alone
Could you live forever? Could you see the day?
Did you feel your whole world fall apart and fade away?

  Get along, get along Kid Charlemagne
  Get along Kid Charlemagne

Now your patrons have all left you in the red
Your low rent friends are dead. This life can be very strange
All those day-glo freaks who used to paint their face
They've joined the human race, some things will never change
Son, you were mistaken You are obsolete
look at all the white men on the street

!Solo

Clean this mess up else we'll all end up in jail
Those test tubes and the scale, just get it all out of here
Is there gas in the car?  Yes, there's gas in the car
I think the people down the hall know who you are
Careful what you carry cause the man is wise.
You are still an outlaw in their eyes
