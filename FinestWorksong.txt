Finest Worksong

B (E F#)

The time to rise has been engaged, you're better best to rearrange
I'm talking here to me alone, I listen to the finest worksong
  Your finest hour

Another chance has been engaged, to throw Thoreau and rearrange
You are following this time, I beg you not, beg to rhyme
  Your finest hour

Take your instinct by the reins, you're better best to rearrange
What we want and what we need, has been confused, been confused
  Your finest hour
