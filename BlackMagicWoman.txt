Black Magic Woman

V: Dm7 Am7 Dm7 Gm Dm7 A7 Dm

I got a black magic woman...
I got a black magic woman got me so blind I can't see
That she's a black magic woman she's tryin' to make a devil out of me

Don't turn your back on me baby...
Yes, don't turn your back on me baby, stop messin' around with your tricks
Don't turn your back on me baby you just might pick up my magic sticks

Got your spell on me baby...
Got your spell on me baby turnin' my heart into stone
I need you so bad magic woman I can't leave you alone
