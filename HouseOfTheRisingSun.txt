House of the rising sun

Am C D F Am E Am E

There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy and God, I know, I'm one

My mother was a tailor she sewed my new blue jeans
My father was a gambling man down in New Orleans.

Now the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time, he's satisfied is when he's on a drunk

O mother, tell your children not to do what I have done
Spend your lives in sin and misery in the house of Rising Sun

Well I got one foot on the platform the other foot on the train
I'm going back to New Orleans to wear that ball and chain
