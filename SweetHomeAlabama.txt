Big wheels keep on turning
Carry me home to see my kin
Singing songs about the south land
I miss 'ole' 'bamy once again and I think it's a sin
 
Well I heard Mr. Young sing about her
Well I heard old Neil put her down
Well I hope Neil Young will remember
A southern man don’t need him around, anyhow
 
  Sweet home Alabama, where the skies are so blue
  Sweet home Alabama, Lord I’m coming home to you

In Birmingham they love the Gov'nor, boo-hoo-hoo
Now we all did what we could do
Now watergate does not bother me
Does you conscience bother you (tell the truth!)

Sweet home Alabama, where the skies are so blue
Sweet home Alabama, Lord I’m coming home to you (Here I come, Alabama)
 
[Solo]
 
Now Muscle Shoals has got the Swappers
And they've been known to pick a song or two (yes we do)
Lord they get me off so much
They pick me up when I'm feeling blue, now how 'bout you?

  Chorus
 
  Sweet home Alabama (Oh, sweet home baby)
  Where the skies are so blue (And the governor's true)
  Sweet Home Alabama, (Lord, yeah)
  Lord, I'm coming home to you (Yeah, yeah)
