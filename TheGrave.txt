The Grave

Am C Dm E7 - Am Dm E7 Am

The grave that they dug him had flowers
Gathered from the hillsides in bright summer colours
And the brown earth bleached white at the edge of his gravestoneâ€¦
He's gone

Dm C E7

V: Am C Dm E7 - Am E7 Am F Dm E7

When the wars of our nation did beckon
A man barely twenty did answer the call
Proud of the trust that he placed in our nation. He is gone.
But eternity knows him and it knows what we've done.

(Am Dm E7) Am E7 - F Dm E7

And the rain fell like pearls on the leaves of the flowers
Leaving brown muddy clay where the earth had been dry
And deep in the trench he waited for hours
As he held to his rifle and prayed not to die

(Dm Am) C Dm E7

But the silence of night was shattered by fire
As guns and grenades blasted sharp through the air
One after another his comrades were slaughtered
In a morgue of marines, alone standing there

(F Dm Am) F Am - F E7 - Am Dm E7

He crouched ever lower, ever lower in fear
They can't let me die, they can't let me die here
I'll cover myself with the mud and the earth
I'll cover myself, I know I'm not brave!
The earth, the earth, the earth is my grave
