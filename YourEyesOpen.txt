Your Eyes Open

V: Em CM Am FM7   C: C G Bm   S: FM7 Am C D Bm

Well it's a lonely road that you have chosen
... Morning comes and you don't want to know me anymore
And it's a long time since your heart was frozen...

  For a moment your eyes open and you know
  All the things I ever wanted you to know
  I don't know you, and I don't want to
  Till the moment your eyes open and you know

That it's a lonely place that you have run to...
And it's a lonely end that you will come to...
