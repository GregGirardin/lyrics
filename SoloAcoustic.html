Good friends we have, oh, good friends we've lost along the way<br>

Said, I remember when we used to sit in the government yard in Trenchtown.<br>

All dressed in satin and waiting by the door<br>

&nbsp&nbspOoh, what a lucky man he was<br>

White lace and feathers they made up his bed<br>
A gold covered mattress on which he was laid<br>
<br>
He went to fight wars for his country and his king<br>
Of his honor and his glory the people would sing<br>

A bullet had found him his blood ran as he cried<br>
No money could save him so he laid down and he died<br>

After two days in the desert sun my skin began to turn red<br>
After three days in the desert fun I was looking at a river bed<br>
And the story it told of a river that flowed made me sad to think it was dead<br>
<br>
After nine days I let the horse run free cause the desert had turned to sea<br>
There were plants and birds and rocks and things there were sand and hills and rings<br>

Under the cities lies a heart made of ground but the humans will give no love<br>

Well I don't know why I came here tonight I got the feeling that something ain't right<br>
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair and I'm wondering how I'll get down the stairs<br>
Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right, here I am, stuck in the middle with you.<br>
<br>
Yes I'm stuck in the middle with you and I'm wondering what it is I should do<br>
It's so hard to keep this smile from my face losing control, yeah, I'm all over the place..<br>
Clowns to the left..<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspWell you started out with nothing and you're proud that you're a self made man<br>
&nbsp&nbspAnd your friends they all come crawlin slap you on the back and say please, please<br>
<br>
Trying to make some sense of it all but I can see that it makes no sense at all<br>
Is it cool to go to sleep on the floor cause I don't think that I can take anymore.<br>

Friday night I'm going nowhere all the lights are changing green to red<br>
Turning over TV stations situations running through my head<br>
Looking back through time you know it's clear that I've been blind I've been a fool<br>
To open up my heart to all that jealousy that bitterness, that ridicule<br>
<br>
Saturday I'm running wild and all the lights are changing red to green<br>
Moving through the crowd I'm pushing chemicals all rushing in my bloodstream<br>
Only wish that you were here you know I'm seeing it so clear I've been afraid<br>
To show you how I really feel admit to some of those bad mistakes I've made<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspIf you want it come and get it crying out loud<br>
&nbsp&nbspThe love that I was giving you was never in doubt<br>
&nbsp&nbspLet go of your heart let go of your head and feel it now (x 2)<br>
&nbsp&nbspBabylon<br>
<br>
Sunday all the lights of London shining sky is fading red to blue<br>
Kicking through the autumn leaves and wondering where it is you might be going to<br>
Turning back for home you know I'm feeling so alone I can't believe<br>
Climbing on the stair I turn around to see you smiling there in front of me<br>

I once had a girl, or should I say she once had me<br>
She showed me her room, isn't it good Norwegian wood<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspShe asked my to stay and told me to sit anywhere<br>
&nbsp&nbspSo I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair<br>
<br>
I sat on a rug, biding my time, drinking her wine<br>
We talked until two, and then she said, it's time for bed<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspShe told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh<br>
&nbsp&nbspI told her I didn't, and crawled off to sleep in the bath<br>
<br>
And when I awoke, I was alone, this bird has flown<br>
So I lit a fire, isn't it good Norwegian wood<br>

<br>
On a warm summer's evenin' on a train bound for nowhere,<br>
I met up with the gambler; we were both too tired to sleep.<br>
So we took turns a starin' out the window at the darkness<br>
'til boredom overtook us, and he began to speak.<br>
<br>
He said, "Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces,<br>
and knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes.<br>
And if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces.<br>
For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice."<br>
<br>
So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow.<br>
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light.<br>
And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression.<br>
Said, "If you're gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right.<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspYou got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em,<br>
&nbsp&nbspknow when to walk away and know when to run.<br>
&nbsp&nbspYou never count your money when you're sittin' at the table.<br>
&nbsp&nbspThere'll be time enough for countin when the dealin's done.<br>
<br>
Ev'ry gambler knows that the secret to survivin<br>
is knowin what to throw away and knowing what to keep.<br>
cause every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser,<br>
and the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep.<br>
<br>
And when he'd finished speakin', he turned back towards the window,<br>
crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep.<br>
And somewhere in the darkness the gambler, he broke even.<br>
But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep.<br>

Early in the morning, risin' to the street<br>
Light me up that cigarette and I strap shoes on my feet<br>
Got to find a reason, a reason things went wrong<br>
Got to find a reason why my money's all gone<br>
I got a dalmatian, and I can still get high<br>
I can play the guitar like a motherfucking riot<br>
<br>
Well, life is too short, so love the one you got<br>
Cause you might get run over or you might get shot<br>
Never start no static I just get it off my chest<br>
Never had to battle with no bulletproof vest<br>
Take a small example, take a tip from me<br>
Take all of your money, give it all to charity<br>
<br>
Love is what I got, it's within my reach<br>
And the Sublime style's still straight from Long Beach<br>
It all comes back to you you'll finally get what you deserve<br>
Try and test that you're bound to get served<br>
Love's what I got don't start a riot<br>
You'll feel it when the dance gets hot<br>

&nbsp&nbspLovin', is what I got, I said remember that<br>

Why I don't cry when my dog runs away<br>
I don't get angry at the bills I have to pay<br>
I don't get angry when my mom smokes pot<br>
Hits the bottle and goes right to the rock<br>

Keep out of reach of children don't you talk to strangers<br>
Get your philosophy from a bumper sticker<br>

Well another crazy day, you drink the night away<br>
And forget about everything<br>

This city desert makes you feel so cold, it's got<br>
So many people but it's got no soul<br>
And it's taken you so long to find out you were wrong<br>
When you thought it held everything<br>

&nbsp&nbspYou used to think that it was so easy<br>
&nbsp&nbspYou used to say that it was so easy<br>

&nbsp&nbspBut you're cryin', you're cryin' now<br>

Way down the street there's a light in his place<br>
You open the door, he's got that look on his face<br>
And he asks you where you've been, you tell him who you've seen<br>
And you talk about anything<br>
<br>
He's got this dream about buyin' some land<br>
He's gonna give up the booze and the one night stands<br>
And then he'll settle down, it's a quiet little town<br>
And forget about everything<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspBut you know he'll always keep moving<br>
&nbsp&nbspYou know he's never gonna stop moving<br>
&nbsp&nbspCause he's rollin', he's the rolling stone<br>

Now I see a family where there once was none, now we've just begun,<br>
Yeah, we're gonna fly to the sun.<br>
<br>
Love the girl who holds the world in a paper cup, drink it up,<br>
Love her and she'll bring you luck.<br>
And if you find she helps your mind, buddy, take her home,<br>
Don't you live alone, try to earn what lovers own.<br>

Doctor, my eyes have seen the years<br>
And the slow parade of fears without crying<br>
Now I want to understand<br>
I have done all that I could, to see the evil and the good<br>
without hiding.&nbsp&nbspYou must help me if you can<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspDoctor, my eyes, tell me what is wrong<br>
&nbsp&nbspWas I unwise to leave them open for so long<br>
<br>
'Cause I have wandered through this world<br>
And as each moment has unfurled, I've been waiting to awaken from these dreams<br>
People go just where they will, I never noticed them until<br>
I got this feeling, that it's later than it seems<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspDoctor, my eyes, tell me what you see<br>
&nbsp&nbspI hear their cries, just say if it's too late for me<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspDoctor, my eyes, they cannot see the sky<br>
&nbsp&nbspIs this the price for having learned how not to cry<br>

Travelling in a fried-out kombi<br>
On a hippy trail, head full of zombie<br>
I met a strange lady, she made me nervous<br>
She took me in and gave me breakfast, and she said<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspDo you come from a land down under<br>
&nbsp&nbspWhere women glow, and men plunder?<br>
&nbsp&nbspCan't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?<br>
&nbsp&nbspYou better run, you better take cover<br>
<br>
Buying bread from a man in Brussels, he was<br>
Six foot four and full of muscles<br>
I said: do you speak-a my language?<br>
He just smiled and gave me a Vegemite sandwich, and he said<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspI come from a land down under<br>
&nbsp&nbspWhere beer does flow and men chunder<br>
&nbsp&nbspCan't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?<br>
&nbsp&nbspYou better run, you better take cover<br>
<br>
Lying in a den in Bombay<br>
With a slack jaw and not much to say<br>
I said to the man: are you trying to tempt me?<br>
Because I come from the land of plenty, and he said<br>

Sometimes I feel the fear of uncertainty stinging clear<br>
And I cant help but ask myself how much I'll let the fear take the wheel and steer<br>
It's driven me before, it seems to have a vague haunting mass appeal<br>
Lately I'm beginning to find that I should be the one behind the wheel<br>

Will I choose water over wine and hold my own and drive, oh oh<br>

The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down of the big lake they called "Gitche Gumee"<br>
The lake, it is said, never gives up her dead when the skies of November turn gloomy<br>
With a load of iron ore twenty-six thousand tons more Than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty.<br>
That good ship and crew was a bone to be chewed When the "Gales of November" came early.<br>
<br>
The ship was the pride of the American side Coming back from some mill in Wisconsin<br>
As the big freighters go, it was bigger than most With a crew and good captain well seasoned<br>
Concluding some terms with a couple of steel firms When they left fully loaded for Cleveland<br>
And later that night when the ship's bell rang Could it be the north wind they'd been feelin'?<br>
<br>
The wind in the wires made a tattle-tale sound and a wave broke over the railing<br>
And every man knew, as the captain did too, twas the witch of November come stealin'.<br>
The dawn came late and the breakfast had to wait when the Gales of November came slashin'.<br>
When afternoon came it was freezin' rain In the face of a hurricane west wind.<br>
<br>
When suppertime came, the old cook came on deck sayin’, "Fellas, it's too rough to feed ya."<br>
At seven PM a main hatchway caved in, he said "Fellas, it's been good t'know ya"<br>
The captain wired in he had water comin' in and the good ship and crew was in peril.<br>
And later that night when 'is lights went outta sight came the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.<br>
<br>
<br>
Does any one know where the love of God goes when the waves turn the minutes to hours?<br>
The searchers all say they'd have made Whitefish Bay if they'd put fifteen more miles behind her.<br>
They might have split up or they might have capsized they may have broke deep and took water.<br>
And all that remains is the faces and the names of the wives and the sons and the daughters.<br>
<br>
Lake Huron rolls, Superior sings in the rooms of her ice-water mansion.<br>
Old Michigan steams like a young man's dreams the islands and bays are for sportsmen.<br>
And farther below Lake Ontario Takes in what Lake Erie can send her,<br>
And the iron boats go as the mariners all know with the Gales of November remembered.<br>
<br>
In a musty old hall in Detroit they prayed, In the "Maritime Sailors' Cathedral."<br>
The church bell chimed till it rang twenty-nine times For each man on the Edmund Fitzgerald.<br>
The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down Of the big lake they call "Gitche Gumee".<br>
"Superior", they said, "never gives up her dead When the 'Gales of November' come early!"<br>

Can you hear the drums Fernando?<br>
I remember long ago another starry night like this<br>
In the firelight Fernando<br>
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar<br>
I could hear the distant drums and sounds<br>
of bugle calls were coming from afar<br>
<br>
They were closer now Fernando<br>
Every hour, every minute seemed to last eternally<br>
I was so afraid Fernando<br>
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die<br>
And I'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons<br>
Almost made me cry<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspThere was something in the air that night<br>
&nbsp&nbspThe stars were bright, Fernando<br>
&nbsp&nbspThey were shining there for you and me, for liberty, Fernando<br>
&nbsp&nbspThough we never thought that we could lose, there's no regret<br>
&nbsp&nbspIf I had to do the same again, I would, my friend, Fernando<br>
&nbsp&nbspIf I had to do the same again, I would, my friend, Fernando<br>
<br>
Now we're old and grey Fernando<br>
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand<br>
Can you hear the drums Fernando?<br>
Do you still recall the fateful night we crossed the Rio Grande?<br>
I can see it in your eyes how proud you were to fight<br>
For freedom in this land<br>
