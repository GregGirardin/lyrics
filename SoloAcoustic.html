Cause, I remember when we used to sit in the government yard in Trenchtown<br>
Observing the hypocrites mingle with the good people we meet<br>
Good friends we have, oh, good friends we've lost along the way<br>
In this great future, you can't forget your past so dry your tears, I say<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspNo, woman, no cry. Little darlin', don't shed no tears<br>

Said, I remember when we used to sit in the government yard in Trenchtown.<br>
And then Georgie would make the fire light log wood burnin through the night<br>
Then we would cook cornmeal porridge of which I'll share with you<br>
My feet is my only carriage so I've got to push on through, but while I'm gone<br>

All dressed in satin and waiting by the door<br>

&nbsp&nbspOoh, what a lucky man he was<br>

White lace and feathers they made up his bed<br>
A gold covered mattress on which he was laid<br>

He went to fight wars for his country and his king<br>
Of his honor and his glory the people would sing<br>
<br>
A bullet had found him his blood ran as he cried<br>
No money could save him so he laid down and he died<br>

After three days in the desert fun I was looking at a river bed<br>
And the story it told of a river that flowed made me sad to think it was dead<br>

After nine days I let the horse run free cause the desert had turned to sea<br>
There were plants and birds and rocks and things there were sand and hills and rings<br>

When the night has come and the land is dark<br>
And the moon is the only light we'll see<br>
No, I won't be afraid  I won't be afraid<br>
Just as long as you stand Stand by me<br>

&nbsp&nbspSo darlin darlin stand by me...<br>
<br>
If the sky that we look upon should tumble and fall<br>
Or the mountain should crumble to the sea<br>
I won't cry, I won't cry no, I won't shed a tear<br>
Just as long as you stand stand by me<br>

Well I don't know why I came here tonight I got the feeling that something ain't right<br>
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair and I'm wondering how I'll get down the stairs<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspClowns to the left of me, jokers to the right,<br>
&nbsp&nbsphere I am, stuck in the middle with you.<br>
<br>
Yes I'm stuck in the middle with you and I'm wondering what it is I should do<br>
It's so hard to keep this smile from my face losing control, yeah, I'm all over the place..<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspClowns to the left..<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWell you started out with nothing and you're proud that you're a self made man<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAnd your friends they all come crawlin slap you on the back and say please, please<br>
<br>
Trying to make some sense of it all but I can see that it makes no sense at all<br>
Is it cool to go to sleep on the floor cause I don't think that I can take anymore..<br>
<br>
<b>Solo</b><br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWell you started out with nothing..<br>

Friday night I'm going nowhere all the lights are changing green to red<br>
Turning over TV stations situations running through my head<br>
Looking back through time you know it's clear that I've been blind I've been a fool<br>
To open up my heart to all that jealousy that bitterness, that ridicule<br>
<br>
Saturday I'm running wild and all the lights are changing red to green<br>
Moving through the crowd I'm pushing chemicals all rushing in my bloodstream<br>
Only wish that you were here you know I'm seeing it so clear I've been afraid<br>
To show you how I really feel admit to some of those bad mistakes I've made<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspIf you want it come and get it crying out loud<br>
&nbsp&nbspThe love that I was giving you was never in doubt<br>
&nbsp&nbspLet go of your heart let go of your head and feel it now (x 2)<br>
&nbsp&nbspBabylon<br>
<br>
Sunday all the lights of London shining sky is fading red to blue<br>
Kicking through the autumn leaves and wondering where it is you might be going to<br>
Turning back for home you know I'm feeling so alone I can't believe<br>
Climbing on the stair I turn around to see you smiling there in front of me<br>

I once had a girl, or should I say she once had me<br>
She showed me her room, isn't it good Norwegian wood<br>
She asked my to stay and told me to sit anywhere<br>
So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair<br>
<br>
I sat on a rug, biding my time, drinking her wine<br>
We talked until two, and then she said, it's time for bed<br>
She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh<br>
I told her I didn't, and crawled off to sleep in the bath<br>
<br>
And when I awoke, I was alone, this bird has flown<br>
So I lit a fire, isn't it good Norwegian wood<br>

See the stone set in your eyes<br>
See the thorn twist in your side, I wait for you<br>
<br>
Sleight of hand and twist of fate<br>
On a bed of nails she makes me wait, and I wait without you<br>

&nbsp&nbspWith or without you<br>
<br>
Through the storm we reach the shore<br>
You give it all but I want more, and I'm waiting for you<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspWith or without you<br>
&nbsp&nbspI can't live with or without you<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspAnd you give yourself away...<br>

My hands are tied, my body bruised, she's got me with<br>
Nothing to win and nothing left to lose<br>

<br>
On a warm summer's evenin' on a train bound for nowhere,<br>
I met up with the gambler; we were both too tired to sleep.<br>
So we took turns a starin' out the window at the darkness<br>
'til boredom overtook us, and he began to speak.<br>
<br>
He said, "Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces,<br>
and knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes.<br>
And if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces.<br>
For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice."<br>
<br>
So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow.<br>
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light.<br>
And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression.<br>
Said, "If you're gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right.<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspYou got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em,<br>
&nbsp&nbspknow when to walk away and know when to run.<br>
&nbsp&nbspYou never count your money when you're sittin' at the table.<br>
&nbsp&nbspThere'll be time enough for countin when the dealin's done.<br>
<br>
Ev'ry gambler knows that the secret to survivin<br>
is knowin what to throw away and knowing what to keep.<br>
cause every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser,<br>
and the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep.<br>
<br>
And when he'd finished speakin', he turned back towards the window,<br>
crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep.<br>
And somewhere in the darkness the gambler, he broke even.<br>
But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep.<br>

Hey use it, everybody use it!<br>
You could have a steam train if you'd just lay down your tracks.<br>
You could have an aeroplane flying if you bring your blue sky back.<br>
All you do is call me I'll be anything you need.<br>

You could have a bumper car bumping this amusement never ends.<br>

Show me round your fruitcage cause I will be your honey bee.<br>
Open up your fruitcage where the fruit is as sweet as can be.<br>

Early in the morning, risin' to the street<br>
Light me up that cigarette and I strap shoes on my feet<br>
Got to find a reason, a reason things went wrong<br>
Got to find a reason why my money's all gone<br>
I got a dalmatian, and I can still get high<br>
I can play the guitar like a motherfucking riot<br>
<br>
Well, life is too short, so love the one you got<br>
Cause you might get run over or you might get shot<br>
Never start no static I just get it off my chest<br>
Never had to battle with no bulletproof vest<br>
Take a small example, take a tip from me<br>
Take all of your money, give it all to charity<br>
<br>
Love is what I got, it's within my reach<br>
And the Sublime style's still straight from Long Beach<br>
It all comes back to you you'll finally get what you deserve<br>
Try and test that you're bound to get served<br>
Love's what I got don't start a riot<br>
You'll feel it when the dance gets hot<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspLovin', is what I got, I said remember that<br>
<br>
Why I don't cry when my dog runs away<br>
I don't get angry at the bills I have to pay<br>
I don't get angry when my mom smokes pot<br>
Hits the bottle and goes right to the rock<br>
Fuckin' and fightin it's all the same<br>
Livin' with Louie dog's the only way to stay sane<br>
Let the lovin' come back to me<br>

So, so you think you can tell, heaven from hell, blue skies from pain<br>
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail, a smile from a veil<br>
Do you think you can tell?<br>
<br>
Did they get you to trade, your heroes for ghosts hot ashes for trees<br>
Hot air for a cool breeze, cold comfort for change<br>
And did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage<br>
<br>
How I wish, how I wish you were here<br>
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year<br>
Running over the same old ground what have we found<br>
the same old fears. Wish you were here<br>
