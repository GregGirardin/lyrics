Cause, I remember when we used to sit in the government yard in Trenchtown<br>
Observing the hypocrites mingle with the good people we meet<br>
Good friends we have, oh, good friends we've lost along the way<br>
In this great future, you can't forget your past so dry your tears, I say<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspNo, woman, no cry. Little darlin', don't shed no tears<br>

Said, I remember when we used to sit in the government yard in Trenchtown.<br>
And then Georgie would make the fire light log wood burnin through the night<br>
Then we would cook cornmeal porridge of which I'll share with you<br>
My feet is my only carriage so I've got to push on through, but while I'm gone<br>

All dressed in satin and waiting by the door<br>

White lace and feathers they made up his bed<br>
A gold covered mattress on which he was laid<br>

He went to fight wars for his country and his king<br>
Of his honor and his glory the people would sing<br>
<br>
A bullet had found him his blood ran as he cried<br>
No money could save him so he laid down and he died<br>

After three days in the desert fun I was looking at a river bed<br>
And the story it told of a river that flowed made me sad to think it was dead<br>
<br>
After nine days I let the horse run free cause the desert had turned to sea<br>
There were plants and birds and rocks and things there were sand and hills and rings<br>

Under the cities lies a heart made of ground but the humans will give no love<br>

Well I don't know why I came here tonight I got the feeling that something ain't right<br>
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair and I'm wondering how I'll get down the stairs<br>
Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right, here I am, stuck in the middle with you.<br>
<br>
Yes I'm stuck in the middle with you and I'm wondering what it is I should do<br>
It's so hard to keep this smile from my face losing control, yeah, I'm all over the place..<br>
Clowns to the left..<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspWell you started out with nothing and you're proud that you're a self made man<br>
&nbsp&nbspAnd your friends they all come crawlin slap you on the back and say please, please<br>
<br>
Trying to make some sense of it all but I can see that it makes no sense at all<br>
Is it cool to go to sleep on the floor cause I don't think that I can take anymore.<br>

Friday night I'm going nowhere all the lights are changing green to red<br>
Turning over TV stations situations running through my head<br>
Looking back through time you know it's clear that I've been blind I've been a fool<br>
To open up my heart to all that jealousy that bitterness, that ridicule<br>
<br>
Saturday I'm running wild and all the lights are changing red to green<br>
Moving through the crowd I'm pushing chemicals all rushing in my bloodstream<br>
Only wish that you were here you know I'm seeing it so clear I've been afraid<br>
To show you how I really feel admit to some of those bad mistakes I've made<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspIf you want it come and get it crying out loud<br>
&nbsp&nbspThe love that I was giving you was never in doubt<br>
&nbsp&nbspLet go of your heart let go of your head and feel it now (x 2)<br>

Sunday all the lights of London shining sky is fading red to blue<br>
Kicking through the autumn leaves and wondering where it is you might be going to<br>
Turning back for home you know I'm feeling so alone I can't believe<br>
Climbing on the stair I turn around to see you smiling there in front of me<br>

I once had a girl, or should I say she once had me<br>
She showed me her room, isn't it good Norwegian wood<br>
She asked my to stay and told me to sit anywhere<br>
So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair<br>
<br>
I sat on a rug, biding my time, drinking her wine<br>
We talked until two, and then she said, it's time for bed<br>
She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh<br>
I told her I didn't, and crawled off to sleep in the bath<br>
<br>
And when I awoke, I was alone, this bird has flown<br>
So I lit a fire, isn't it good Norwegian wood<br>

On a warm summer's evenin' on a train bound for nowhere,<br>
I met up with the gambler; we were both too tired to sleep.<br>
So we took turns a starin' out the window at the darkness<br>
'til boredom overtook us, and he began to speak.<br>
<br>
He said, "Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces,<br>
and knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes.<br>
And if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces.<br>
For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice."<br>
<br>
So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow.<br>
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light.<br>
And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression.<br>
Said, "If you're gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right.<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspYou got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em,<br>
&nbsp&nbspknow when to walk away and know when to run.<br>
&nbsp&nbspYou never count your money when you're sittin' at the table.<br>
&nbsp&nbspThere'll be time enough for countin when the dealin's done.<br>
<br>
Ev'ry gambler knows that the secret to survivin<br>
is knowin what to throw away and knowing what to keep.<br>
cause every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser,<br>
and the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep.<br>
<br>
And when he'd finished speakin', he turned back towards the window,<br>
crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep.<br>
And somewhere in the darkness the gambler, he broke even.<br>
But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep.<br>

Early in the morning, risin' to the street<br>
Light me up that cigarette and I strap shoes on my feet<br>
Got to find a reason, a reason things went wrong<br>
Got to find a reason why my money's all gone<br>
I got a dalmatian, and I can still get high<br>
I can play the guitar like a motherfucking riot<br>
<br>
Well, life is too short, so love the one you got<br>
Cause you might get run over or you might get shot<br>
Never start no static I just get it off my chest<br>
Never had to battle with no bulletproof vest<br>
Take a small example, take a tip from me<br>
Take all of your money, give it all to charity<br>
<br>
Love is what I got, it's within my reach<br>
And the Sublime style's still straight from Long Beach<br>
It all comes back to you you'll finally get what you deserve<br>
Try and test that you're bound to get served<br>
Love's what I got don't start a riot<br>
You'll feel it when the dance gets hot<br>

Why I don't cry when my dog runs away<br>
I don't get angry at the bills I have to pay<br>
I don't get angry when my mom smokes pot<br>
Hits the bottle and goes right to the rock<br>

'Cause the truth you might be runnin from is so small but it's as big as the promise, the promise of a coming day<br>

This is a public service announcement this is only a test<br>
Emergency evacuation protest<br>
May impair your ability to operate machinery<br>
Can't quite tell just what it means to me<br>
Keep out of reach of children don't you talk to strangers<br>
Get your philosophy from a bumper sticker<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspWarning, live without warning.. without, alright<br>
<br>
Better homes and safety-sealed communities<br>
Did you remember to pay the utilities?<br>
Caution police line you better not cross<br>
Is the cop or am I the one that's really dangerous?<br>
Sanitation, expiration date, question everything<br>
Or shut up and be a victim of authority<br>

Nobody on the road, nobody on the beach.<br>
I feel it in the air, the summer's out of reach.<br>
Empty lake, empty streets, the sun goes down alone.<br>
I'm driving by your house, though I know your not home.<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspBut I can see you, your brown skin shining in the sun.<br>
&nbsp&nbspYou got your hair combed back and your sunglasses on, baby.<br>
&nbsp&nbspI can tell you my love for you will still be strong<br>
&nbsp&nbspAfter the boys of summer have gone.<br>
<br>
I never will forget those nights, I wonder if it was a dream.<br>
Remember how you made me crazy, remember how I made you scream.<br>
Now I don't understand what happened to our love.<br>
But, baby, when I get you back, I'm gonna show you what I'm made of.<br>

Out on the road today I saw a Black Flag Sticker on a Cadillac.<br>
A little voice inside my head said: "Don't look back, you can never look back."<br>
I thought I knew what love was. What did I know?<br>
Those days are gone forever, I should just let them go, but<br>

I feel so unsure as I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor<br>
As the music dies, something in your eyes<br>
Calls to mind a silver screen and all its sad goodbyes<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspI'm never gonna dance again, guilty feet have got no rhythm<br>
&nbsp&nbspThough it's easy to pretend I know your not a fool<br>
&nbsp&nbspShould've known better than to cheat a friend and waste the chance that I've been given<br>
&nbsp&nbspSo I'm never gonna dance again the way I danced with you<br>
<br>
Time can never mend the careless whispers of a good friend<br>
To the heart and mind ignorance is kind<br>
There's no comfort in the truth pain is all you'll find<br>
<br>
Tonight the music seems so loud I wish that we could lose this crowd<br>
Maybe it's better this way we'd hurt each other with the things we'd want to say<br>
We could have been so good together we could have lived this dance forever<br>

Bless your soul. You really think you're in control<br>

&nbsp&nbspWell, I think you're crazy! Just like me.<br>

My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on a limb<br>

The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down of the big lake they called "Gitche Gumee"<br>
The lake, it is said, never gives up her dead when the skies of November turn gloomy<br>
With a load of iron ore twenty-six thousand tons more Than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty.<br>
That good ship and crew was a bone to be chewed When the "Gales of November" came early.<br>
<br>
The ship was the pride of the American side Coming back from some mill in Wisconsin<br>
As the big freighters go, it was bigger than most With a crew and good captain well seasoned<br>
Concluding some terms with a couple of steel firms When they left fully loaded for Cleveland<br>
And later that night when the ship's bell rang Could it be the north wind they'd been feelin'?<br>
<br>
The wind in the wires made a tattle-tale sound and a wave broke over the railing<br>
And every man knew, as the captain did too, twas the witch of November come stealin'.<br>
The dawn came late and the breakfast had to wait when the Gales of November came slashin'.<br>
When afternoon came it was freezin' rain In the face of a hurricane west wind.<br>
<br>
When suppertime came, the old cook came on deck sayin’, "Fellas, it's too rough to feed ya."<br>
At seven PM a main hatchway caved in, he said "Fellas, it's been good t'know ya"<br>
The captain wired in he had water comin' in and the good ship and crew was in peril.<br>
And later that night when 'is lights went outta sight came the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.<br>
<br>
<br>
Does any one know where the love of God goes when the waves turn the minutes to hours?<br>
The searchers all say they'd have made Whitefish Bay if they'd put fifteen more miles behind her.<br>
They might have split up or they might have capsized they may have broke deep and took water.<br>
And all that remains is the faces and the names of the wives and the sons and the daughters.<br>
<br>
Lake Huron rolls, Superior sings in the rooms of her ice-water mansion.<br>
Old Michigan steams like a young man's dreams the islands and bays are for sportsmen.<br>
And farther below Lake Ontario Takes in what Lake Erie can send her,<br>
And the iron boats go as the mariners all know with the Gales of November remembered.<br>
<br>
In a musty old hall in Detroit they prayed, In the "Maritime Sailors' Cathedral."<br>
The church bell chimed till it rang twenty-nine times For each man on the Edmund Fitzgerald.<br>
The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down Of the big lake they call "Gitche Gumee".<br>
"Superior", they said, "never gives up her dead When the 'Gales of November' come early!"<br>

Can you hear the drums Fernando?<br>
I remember long ago another starry night like this<br>
In the firelight Fernando<br>
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar<br>
I could hear the distant drums and sounds<br>
of bugle calls were coming from afar<br>
<br>
They were closer now Fernando<br>
Every hour, every minute seemed to last eternally<br>
I was so afraid Fernando<br>
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die<br>
And I'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons<br>
Almost made me cry<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspThere was something in the air that night<br>
&nbsp&nbspThe stars were bright, Fernando<br>
&nbsp&nbspThey were shining there for you and me, for liberty, Fernando<br>
&nbsp&nbspThough we never thought that we could lose, there's no regret<br>
&nbsp&nbspIf I had to do the same again, I would, my friend, Fernando<br>
&nbsp&nbspIf I had to do the same again, I would, my friend, Fernando<br>
<br>
Now we're old and grey Fernando<br>
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand<br>
Can you hear the drums Fernando?<br>
Do you still recall the fateful night we crossed the Rio Grande?<br>
I can see it in your eyes how proud you were to fight<br>
For freedom in this land<br>

On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair<br>
Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air<br>
Up ahead in the distance I saw a shimmering light<br>
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim I had to stop for the night<br>
<br>
There she stood in the doorway, I heard the mission bell<br>
And I was thinking to myself, "This could be heaven or this could be hell"<br>
Then she lit up a candle, and she showed me the way<br>
There were voices down the corridor, I thought I heard them say<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspWelcome to the Hotel California such a lovely place, such a lovely face<br>
&nbsp&nbspPlenty of room at the Hotel California any time of year, you can find it here<br>
<br>
Her mind is Tiffany twisted, she got the Mercedes Benz<br>
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, she calls friends<br>
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat<br>
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget<br>
<br>
So I called up the Captain, "Please bring me my wine"<br>
He said, "We haven't had that spirit here since 1969"<br>
And still those voices are calling from far away<br>
Wake you up in the middle of the night, just to hear them say<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspWelcome to the Hotel California such a lovely place, such a lovely face<br>
&nbsp&nbspThey living it up at the Hotel California what a nice surprise, bring your alibis<br>
<br>
Mirrors on the ceiling, pink champagne on ice<br>
And she said: "We are all just prisoners here, of our own device"<br>
And in the master's chambers they gathered for the feast<br>
They stab it with their steely knives but they just can't kill the beast<br>
<br>
Last thing I remember, I was running for the door<br>
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before<br>
"Relax," said the night man "We are programmed to receive,<br>
you can check out any time you like but you can never leave"<br>

There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun<br>
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy and God, I know, I'm one<br>
<br>
My mother was a tailor she sewed my new blue jeans<br>
My father was a gambling man down in New Orleans.<br>
<br>
Now the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk<br>
And the only time, he's satisfied is when he's on a drunk<br>
<br>
O mother, tell your children not to do what I have done<br>
Spend your lives in sin and misery in the house of Rising Sun<br>
<br>
Well I got one foot on the platform the other foot on the train<br>
I'm going back to New Orleans to wear that ball and chain<br>
