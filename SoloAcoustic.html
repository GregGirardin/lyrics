Cause, I remember when we used to sit in the government yard in Trenchtown<br>
Observing the hypocrites mingle with the good people we meet<br>
Good friends we have, oh, good friends we've lost along the way<br>
In this great future, you can't forget your past so dry your tears, I say<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspNo, woman, no cry. Little darlin', don't shed no tears<br>

Said, I remember when we used to sit in the government yard in Trenchtown.<br>
And then Georgie would make the fire light log wood burnin through the night<br>
Then we would cook cornmeal porridge of which I'll share with you<br>
My feet is my only carriage so I've got to push on through, but while I'm gone<br>

All dressed in satin and waiting by the door<br>

&nbsp&nbspOoh, what a lucky man he was<br>
<br>
White lace and feathers they made up his bed<br>
A gold covered mattress on which he was laid<br>
<br>
He went to fight wars for his country and his king<br>
Of his honor and his glory the people would sing<br>
<br>
A bullet had found him his blood ran as he cried<br>
No money could save him so he laid down and he died<br>

After nine days I let the horse run free cause the desert had turned to sea<br>

Well I don't know why I came here tonight I got the feeling that something ain't right<br>
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair and I'm wondering how I'll get down the stairs<br>
Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right, here I am, stuck in the middle with you.<br>
<br>
Yes I'm stuck in the middle with you and I'm wondering what it is I should do<br>
It's so hard to keep this smile from my face losing control, yeah, I'm all over the place..<br>
Clowns to the left..<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspWell you started out with nothing and you're proud that you're a self made man<br>
&nbsp&nbspAnd your friends they all come crawlin slap you on the back and say please, please<br>
<br>
Trying to make some sense of it all but I can see that it makes no sense at all<br>
Is it cool to go to sleep on the floor cause I don't think that I can take anymore.<br>

Friday night I'm going nowhere all the lights are changing green to red<br>
Turning over TV stations situations running through my head<br>
Looking back through time you know it's clear that I've been blind I've been a fool<br>
To open up my heart to all that jealousy that bitterness, that ridicule<br>
<br>
Saturday I'm running wild and all the lights are changing red to green<br>
Moving through the crowd I'm pushing chemicals all rushing in my bloodstream<br>
Only wish that you were here you know I'm seeing it so clear I've been afraid<br>
To show you how I really feel admit to some of those bad mistakes I've made<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspIf you want it come and get it crying out loud<br>
&nbsp&nbspThe love that I was giving you was never in doubt<br>
&nbsp&nbspLet go of your heart let go of your head and feel it now (x 2)<br>

Sunday all the lights of London shining sky is fading red to blue<br>
Kicking through the autumn leaves and wondering where it is you might be going to<br>
Turning back for home you know I'm feeling so alone I can't believe<br>
Climbing on the stair I turn around to see you smiling there in front of me<br>

I once had a girl, or should I say she once had me<br>
She showed me her room, isn't it good Norwegian wood<br>
She asked my to stay and told me to sit anywhere<br>
So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair<br>
<br>
I sat on a rug, biding my time, drinking her wine<br>
We talked until two, and then she said, it's time for bed<br>
She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh<br>
I told her I didn't, and crawled off to sleep in the bath<br>
<br>
And when I awoke, I was alone, this bird has flown<br>

On a warm summer's evenin' on a train bound for nowhere,<br>
I met up with the gambler; we were both too tired to sleep.<br>
So we took turns a starin' out the window at the darkness<br>
'til boredom overtook us, and he began to speak.<br>
<br>
He said, "Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces,<br>
and knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes.<br>
And if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces.<br>
For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice."<br>
<br>
So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow.<br>
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light.<br>
And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression.<br>
Said, "If you're gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right.<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspYou got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em,<br>
&nbsp&nbspknow when to walk away and know when to run.<br>
&nbsp&nbspYou never count your money when you're sittin' at the table.<br>
&nbsp&nbspThere'll be time enough for countin when the dealin's done.<br>
<br>
Ev'ry gambler knows that the secret to survivin<br>
is knowin what to throw away and knowing what to keep.<br>
cause every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser,<br>
and the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep.<br>
<br>
And when he'd finished speakin', he turned back towards the window,<br>
crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep.<br>
And somewhere in the darkness the gambler, he broke even.<br>
But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep.<br>

Light me up that cigarette and I strap shoes on my feet<br>
Got to find a reason, a reason things went wrong<br>
Got to find a reason why my money's all gone<br>
I got a dalmatian, and I can still get high<br>
I can play the guitar like a motherfucking riot<br>

Well, life is too short, so love the one you got<br>
Cause you might get run over or you might get shot<br>
Never start no static I just get it off my chest<br>
Never had to battle with no bulletproof vest<br>
Take a small example, take a tip from me<br>
Take all of your money, give it all to charity<br>

Love is what I got, it's within my reach<br>
And the Sublime style's still straight from Long Beach<br>
It all comes back to you you'll finally get what you deserve<br>

Why I don't cry when my dog runs away<br>

Hits the bottle and goes right to the rock<br>

This is a public service announcement this is only a test<br>
Emergency evacuation protest<br>
May impair your ability to operate machinery<br>
Can't quite tell just what it means to me<br>
Keep out of reach of children don't you talk to strangers<br>
Get your philosophy from a bumper sticker<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspWarning, live without warning.. without, alright<br>
<br>
Better homes and safety-sealed communities<br>
Did you remember to pay the utilities?<br>
Caution police line you better not cross<br>
Is the cop or am I the one that's really dangerous?<br>
Sanitation, expiration date, question everything<br>
Or shut up and be a victim of authority<br>

I guess you wonder where I've been I searched to find the love within<br>
I came back to let you know got a thing for you and I can't let it go<br>
<br>
My friends wonder what is wrong with me, well I'm in a daze from your love you see<br>
I came back to let you know got a thing for you and I can't let it go<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspSome people go around the world for love<br>
&nbsp&nbspAnd they may never find what they dream of<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWhat you won't do, you do for love<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspyou tried everything but you don't give up<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn my world only you<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspmade me do for love what I would not do<br>

The world was on fire and no one could save me but you<br>
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do<br>
I never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you<br>
I never dreamed that I'd love somebody like you<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspI don't want to fall in love<br>
&nbsp&nbspThis world is only gonna break your heart<br>
<br>
What a wicked game to play, to make me feel this way<br>
What a wicked thing to do, to let me dream of you<br>
What a wicked thing to say, you never felt this way<br>
What a wicked thing to do, to make me dream of you<br>

She comes down from Yellow Mountain on a dark, flat land she rides<br>
On a pony she named Wildfire whirlwind by her side<br>
On a cold Nebraska night.<br>
<br>
Oh, they say she died one winter when there came an early frost<br>
And the pony she named Wildfire busted down its stall,<br>
In a blizzard she was lost.<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspShe ran calling Wildfire...<br>
<br>
So by the dark of the moon I planted but there came an early snow.<br>
Been a hoot owl howlin' outside my window now about six nights in a row.<br>
She's coming for me, I know and on Wildfire, we're both gonna go.<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspWe'll be riding Wildfire..<br>

Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you<br>
By now you should've somehow realised what you gotta do<br>
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now<br>

Backbeat the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out<br>
I'm sure you've heard it all before but you never really had a doubt<br>
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspAnd all the roads we have to walk are winding<br>
&nbsp&nbspAnd all the lights that lead us there are blinding<br>
&nbsp&nbspThere are many things that I would Like to say to you<br>
&nbsp&nbspBut I don't know how<br>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBecause maybe you're gonna be the one that saves me?<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAnd after all you're my wonderwall<br>

Oh, what a thing to have done, and it was all yellow<br>

&nbsp&nbspYour skin oh yeah your skin and bones turn in to something beautiful<br>
&nbsp&nbspBut you know, you know I love you so you know I love you so<br>

I swam across, I jumped across for you<br>
Oh, what a thing to do, cos you were all yellow<br>
I drew a line, I drew a line for you<br>
Oh, what a thing to do, and it was all yellow<br>
