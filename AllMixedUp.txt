All Mixed Up

(C#M7 Dm Bb) (Bb Ab)

You've got to trust your instinct and let go of regret
You've got to bet on yourself now star Cause that's your best bet
Watch me now with a wicked and wild and I said
We come with the funky style that gets us known for the show
And we'll mix the hip hop reggae if we say it is so
And fuck the naysayers cause they don't mean a thing
Cause this is what style we bring

Now it's morning but last night's on my mind
There's something I need to get off my chest
And no matter what may come to shine
The dream will always be mine

  All mixed up, you don't know what to do
  Next thing you turn around and find the person is you
  Thought a freak might be the thing
  But the first could be the last, so just get off of your ass

  All mixed up, you don't know what to do
  Next thing you turnaround and find the person is you
  Thought a freak might be the thing
  But you know this will pass, so just get off of your ass

You've got to trust your instinct and let go of regret
You've got to bet on yourself now star cause that's your best bet
Watch me now with a wicked and wild and I said
Sick sick bit got to have it Like bustin' in on a session but you got to call it quits
Sick sick bit just can't quit
Fact that you don't even know makes it fully legit

Now it's morning but...
You keep me coming, that is a gal that'll kill them stunning x 4

You make me nervous, throat dry, my brain is empty, don't know why
But I saw you doing something which is really truly nothing
But you could bust me out all day

Many moons since first I saw you, many moons since first we did the do x 2
And why did I try when I knew it was no and
Why did I try when I say it was so
But save it for late we should just let it skate
'Cause the waiting feel is fine
