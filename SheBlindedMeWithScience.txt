It's poetry in motion, she turned her tender eyes to me
As deep as any ocean, as sweet as any harmony
Mmm, but she blinded me with science and failed me in biology

When I'm dancing close to her, blinding me with science - science!
I can smell the chemicals blinding me with science

Mmm, but it's poetry in motion, and when she turned her eyes to me
As deep as any ocean, as sweet as any harmony
Mmm, but she blinded me with science And failed me in geology

When she's dancing next to me blinding me with science
Mmm, I can hear machinery blinding me with science
It's poetry in motion, and now she's making love to me
The spheres are in commotion, the elements in harmony
She blinded me with science.. and hit me with technology

Good heavens Miss Sakamoto - you're beautiful!

    I don't believe it, there she goes again!
    She's tidied up, and I can't find anything!
    All my tubes and wires, and careful notes, and antiquated notions

But, it's poetry in motion, and when she turned her eyes to me
As deep as any ocean, as sweet as any harmony
She blinded me with science
