Wayfaring Stranger

V: Am Dm E Am
C: F C F E

I'm just a poor wayfaring stranger
Travelling through this world below
There is no sickness no toil, nor danger
In that bright land to which I go
 
  I'm going there to see my father
  And all my loved ones who've gone on
  I'm just going over Jordan
  I'm just going over home
 
I know dark clouds Will gather round me
I know my way is hard and steep
But beauteous fields arise before me
Where God's redeemed their vigils keep
 
  I'm going there To see my mother
  She said she'd meet me When I come
