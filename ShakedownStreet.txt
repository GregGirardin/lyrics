You tell me this town ain't got no heart. Well, well, well, you can never tell.
The sunny side of the street is dark. Well...
Maybe that's cause it's midnight, in the dark of the moon besides.
Maybe the dark is from your eyes... You know you got such dark eye!Solo

  Nothin' shakin' on Shakedown Street. Used to be the heart of town.
  Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart. You just gotta poke around.

You think you've seen this town clear through. Well...
Nothin' here that could intrest you. Well...
It's not because you missed out on the thing that we had to start.
Maybe you had too much too fast... Or just over played your part.

  !Chorus

Since I'm passing your way today. Well...
I just stopped in 'cause I want to say...
I recall your darkness when it crackled like a thundercloud.
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart... When I can hear it beat out loud!

  !Chorus
