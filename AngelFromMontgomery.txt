Angel From Montgomery

V: (G C) D G

I am an old woman named after my mother.
My old man is another child that's grown old.
If dreams were lightning and thunder were desire
this old house would've burnt down a long time ago.

  Make me an angel that flies from Montgomery.
  Make me a poster of an old rodeo.
  Just give me one thing that I can hold on to.
  To believe in this living is just a hard way to go.

When I was a young girl I had me a cowboy,
He wa'rn't much to look at, just a free ramblin' man.
But that was a long time, and no matter how I try,
the years just flow by like a broken-down dam.

Chorus

There's flies in the kitchen, I can hear all their buzzin'
but I ain't done nothin' since I woke up today.
But how the hell can a person go to work in the morning
come home in the evenin' and have nothin' to say?

Chorus
