Thank you for being a friend traveled down a road and back again
Your heart is true, you´re a pal and a confidant
I´m not ashamed to say I hope it always will stay this way
My hat is off won´t you stand up and take a bow

  F#m                      A7/E A/D                C#7
      And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew
         Em9      A7 Bm7                    F#m
  Well, you would see the biggest gift would be from me
           D         D/C#       D/B           D/A        E
  And the card attached would say

    Thank you for being a friend

If it´s a car you lack I´d surely buy you a Cadillac
Whatever you need any time of the day or night
I´m not ashamed to say I hope it always will stay this way
My hat is off won´t you stand up and take a bow

  And when we both get older with walking canes and hair of gray
  Have no fear even though it's hardly here I will stand real close and say

    Thank you for being a friend (I wanna thank you)

C#) E F# Em6/G (Em6/G)
   And when we die, and float away into the night, the milky way
   You'll hear me call as we ascend I'll say your name then once again
