And I Love Her

V: (Em Bm) G A D
C: (Bm F#m) A

I give her all my love that's all I do
And if you saw my love you'd love her too, I love her

She gives me everything and tenderly
The kiss my lover brings she brings to me, and I love her

  A love like ours could never die
  As long as I have you near me

Bright are the stars that shine dark is the sky
I know this love of mine will never die, and I love her

Solo

Bright are the stars..
