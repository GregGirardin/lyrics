No Excuses

V: (G A)  C:(F G [A | D])

It's alright there comes a time got no patience to search for peace of mind.
Layin low, want to take it slow no more hiding or disguising truths I sold.

  Every day it's something hits me all so cold.
  You find me sittin by myself, no excuses, that I know.

It's okay, had a bad day hands are bruised from breaking rocks all day.
Drained and blue, I bleed for you you think it's funny, well you're drowning in it too.

!Chorus
!Solo

Yeah, it's fine, we'll walk down the line leave our rain a cold trade for warm sunshine.
You my friend I will defend and if we change, well, I love you anyway.

!Chorus
