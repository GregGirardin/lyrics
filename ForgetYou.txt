Forget You
 
 C D F C
 
  I see you driving round town with the girl I love
  And I'm like "Forget you!"  Ooo ooo ooo
  I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
  And I'm like "Forget you, and forget her too."
  If I was richer, I'd still be with ya
  Now ain't that something (Ain't that something)
  And though there's pain in my chest I still wish you the best
  With a "Forget you"
 
I said I'm sorry...I can't afford a Ferrari
But that don't mean I can't get you there
I guess he's an Xbox...and I'm more Atari
But the way you play your game ain't fair
 
I pity the fool who falls in love with you
Oh she's a gold digger, just thought you should know
Ooooooooo, I got some news for you
You can go run and tell your boyfriend
 
Now I know I had to borrow, beg and steal and lie and cheat
Tryin to keep ya, tryin' to please ya
Cause being in love with your ain't cheap
 
I pity the fool...

    Now baby, baby, baby, why'd you wanna wanna hurt me so bad?
    (so bad, so bad, so bad)
    I tried to tell my mamma but she told me
    "This is one for your dad"
    (Your dad, your dad, your dad)
    Yes she did
