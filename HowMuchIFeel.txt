I don't know how this whole business started of you thinkin' that I have been untrue
But if you think that we'd be better parted it's gonna hurt me, but I'll Break away from you
Well, just give me the sign and I will be gone, yeah

  That's how much I feel feel for you, baby
  How much I need well I need your touch
  How much I live I live for your lovin’
  That's how much...

I sleep alone, and late at night I'm dreamin' ff the togetherness that seems to be leavin’ me,  oh no
I'd give it all and then I'd give some more If you would only love me like you had before
Girl, take hold of my hand and all will be forgiven, yeah

Chorus

    So you try try to stay in the middle
    And then you cry, well you cry just a little
    Then you both realize just how foolish you've been
    And you try to make amends but you're better off as friends
    Cause that's how much that's how much

How's your life been goin' on I've got a wife now years we've been growin' strong, oh no
There's just something that I've got to say
Sometimes when we make love I still see your face
Ooo, just try to recall when we were as one, yeah

Chorus
