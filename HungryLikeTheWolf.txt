Hungry Like The Wolf

Dark in the city, night is a wire, steam in the subway, the earth is a-fire
Do do doo do, do doo do, do doo do, do doo do, do do do
Woman you want me, give me a sign and catch me breathing even closer be-hind
Do do doo do, do doo do, do doo do, do doo do, do do do
 
  In touch with the ground, I'm on the hunt, I'm after you
  I smell like I sound, I'm lost in a crowd and I'm hungry like the wolf
  Straddle the line, in discord and rhyme, I'm on the hunt, I'm after you
  Mouth is alive, with juices like wine, and I'm hungry like the wolf
 
Stalked in the forest, too close to hide, I'll be upon you by the moonlight side
Do do doo do, do doo do, do doo do, do doo do, do do do
High blood drumming on your skin it's so tight, you feel my heat, I'm just a moment be-hind
Do do doo do, do doo do, do doo do, do doo do, do do do
 
  In touch with the ground, I'm on the hunt I'm after you
  Scent and a sound, I'm lost and I'm found and I'm hungry like the wolf
  Straddle the line, it's discord and rhyme, I howl and I whine, I'm after you
  Mouth is a-live, all running in-side, and I'm hungry like the wolf
 
    Hungry like the wolf
 
  Burning the ground, I break from the crowd, I'm on the hunt, I'm after you
  I smell like I sound, I'm lost and I'm found and I'm hungry like the wolf

  Straddle the line, it's discord and rhyme, I'm on the hunt, I'm after you
  Mouth is a-live with juices like wine and I'm hungry like the wolf
