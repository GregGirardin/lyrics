Ain't Talkin Bout Love

I heard the news baby all about your disease
Yeah, you may have all you want baby
But I got somethin' you need, oh yeah!

  Ain't talkin 'bout love my love is rotten to the core
  Ain't talkin 'bout love just like I told you before

You know you're semi-good lookin'
And on the streets again
Ooh yeah, you think you're really cookin' baby
You better find yourself a friend, my friend

Chorus / Solo / Chorus

    I've been to the edge and then I stood and looked down
    You know I lost a lot of friends there, baby
    I've got no time to mess around
    Mmm, so if you want it, got to bleed for it, baby
    Yeah! Got to, got to bleed, baby..

Chorus

Ain't talkin' / Don't wanna / Don't need to / Ain't gonna
No more! No more! Aah!
Hey, hey, hey!
