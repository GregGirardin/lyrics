Uh huh huh, oh yeah, work, work

Somebody told me "Boy, everything she wants is everything she sees"
I guess I must have loved you because I said you were the perfect girl for me baby
And now we're six months older and everything you want and everything you see
Is out of reach, not good enough I don't know what the hell you want from me oh

  Uh huh.. oh...
  Somebody tell me.. won't you tell me
  Why I work so hard for you? Give you money all to give you money

Some people work for a living some people work for fun girl, I just work for you
They told me marriage was a give and take well show me you can take you've got some giving to do
And now you tell me that you're having my baby I'll tell you that I'm happy if you want me to
One step further and my back will break if my best isn't good enough Then how can it be good enough for two?

Chorus

  Why do I do the things I do? I'd tell you if I knew
  My God I don't even think that I love you

    How could you settle for a boy like me
    When all I could see was the end of the week
    All the things we sign and the things we buy
    Ain't gonna keep us together it's just a matter of time

    My situation never changes walking in and out of that door
    Like a stranger for the wages I give you all you say you want more

    And all I could see was the end of the week
    All the things we sign and the things we buy
    Ain't gonna keep us together girl it's just a matter of time

Chorus
