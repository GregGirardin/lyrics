Wanted Dead or Alive

It's all the same only the names will change
And ev'ry day it seems we're wasting away
Another place where the faces are so cold
I'd drive all night just to get back home
 
  I'm a cowboy on a steel horse I ride
  I'm wanted dead or alive, wanted dead or alive
 
Sometimes I sleep sometimes is not for days
and people I meet always go their separate ways
Sometimes you tell the day by the bottle that you drink
And times when all you do is think

Chorus

And I walk these streets a loaded six string on my back
I play for keeps 'cause I might not make it back
I been ev'ry where still I'm standig tall
I've seen a milion faces and I've rock them all
 
Chorus
