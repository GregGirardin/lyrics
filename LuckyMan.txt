Lucky Man

V: G D    C: Am Em D

He had white horses and ladies by the score
All dressed in satin and waiting by the door

  Ooh, what a lucky man he was

White lace and feathers they made up his bed
A gold covered mattress on which he was laid

He went to fight wars for his country and his king
Of his honor and his glory the people would sing

A bullet had found him his blood ran as he cried
No money could save him so he laid down and he died
