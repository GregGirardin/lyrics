Run To You

V: F#m A B
P: D E
C: F#m A E B

She says her love for me could never die
But that'll change if she'd ever find out about you and I
O, but her love is cold it wouldn't hurt her if she didn't know, 'cuz
When it gets too much I need to feel your touch

  I'm gonna run to you, I'm gonna run to you
  'Cuz when the feeling's right I'm gonna run all night
  I'm gonna run to you
  
She's got a heart of gold she'd never let me down 
But you're the one that always turns me on, you keep me coming round 
I know her love is true but it's so damn easy making love to you 
I got my mind made up I need to feel your touch
