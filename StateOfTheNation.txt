State Of The Nation

Em7 C Bm7

You can walk or you can run, you don't have to be someone
I went on a summer cruise upon an ocean born to lose
My brother said that he was dead I saw his face and shook my head
Can you see where we can't be we're losing our blood in the sea

  Cause it's the state of the nation that's holding our salvation..
  Oh, the state of the nation, is causing deprivation..

From my home I traveled far I drove in my stolen car
When it broke down I kissed the ground cause I don't kiss when you're around
I don't find that I have been the portrait of an only son
If that's the case then who could tell where my story had begun?

Even now, I'm all alone behind a wall that's made of stone
I think about where we have been and all the sights that could be seen
I know it all could be worthwhile if only I could force a smile
Now we turn our backs to the sea the shame of a nation we'll never be
