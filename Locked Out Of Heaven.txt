Locked Out Of Heaven

V: (C Dm C Bb F Gm) F Gm - F A
C: Bb Gm F C
 
Oh yeah yeah. 
 
Never had much faith in love or miracles
Never would have put my heart on the line
But swimming in your world is something spiritual 
I'm born again every time you spend the night
 
  Cause your sex takes me to paradise
  Yeah, your sex takes me to paradise
  And it shows, yeah, yeah, yeah
 
  Cause you make me feel like
  I’ve been locked out of heaven for too long
 
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah ooh  

You bring me to my knees you make me testify
You could make a sinner change his ways
Open up your gates cause I can’t wait to see the light
And right there is where I want to stay, stay
 
  Cause your sex takes me to paradise .
 
    Oh woah woah...
    Can't I just stay here
    Spend the rest of my days here
 
Chorus
