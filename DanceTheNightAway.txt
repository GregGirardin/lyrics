Dance The Night Away

V: E E4 B A - E E4 A B
C: B C#m B

Have you seen her? So fine and pretty fooled me with her style and ease
And I feel her from across the room yes, it's love in the third degree

  Ooh, baby baby, won't-cha turn your head my way?
  Ooh, baby baby, ah come on! take a chance, you're old enough to
  Dance the night away
  Dance, dance, dance the night away

A live wire, barely a beginner but just watch that lady go
She's on fire, 'cause dancin' gets her higher than-uh anything else she knows

!Chorus

Dance the night away
Dance, dance, dance the night away
