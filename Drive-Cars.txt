Drive

V: A AM7 A
C: F#m B

Who's gonna tell you when it's too late
Who's gonna tell you things aren't so great

  You can't go on, thinking nothing's wrong
  Who's gonna drive you home tonight

Who's gonna pick you up when you fall
Who's gonna hang it up when you call
Who's gonna pay attention to your dreams
And who's gonna plug your ears when you scream

!Chorus
!Harmonica A

Who's gonna hold you down, when you shake
Who's gonna come around, when you break

!Chorus
