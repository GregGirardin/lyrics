Jack & Diane

A little ditty bout Jack and Diane
Two American kids growin' up in the heartland
Jack, he's gonna be a football star
Diane debutante, back seat of Jacky's car
 
Suckin' on chili dog outside the Tasty Freeze
Diane sittin' on Jacky's lap, he got his hands between her knees
Jacky says "Hey Diane, lets run off behind a shady tree"
Dribble off those Bobby Brooks, let me do what I   please, sayin'
 
  Ooh yeah, Life goes on
  Long after the thrill of livin' is gone, sayin'
 âˆ‘
Jack, he sits back, collects his thoughts for a moment
Scratches his head and does his best James Dean
"Well then there Diane, we gotta run off to the city"
Diane says, "Baby you ain't missing a thing", but Jacky says
 
Chorus
    
    Oh, let it rock, let it roll.
    Let the Bible belt come and save my soul
    Holdin' on to sixteen as long as you can
    Change is comin' 'round real soon, make us women and men

Chorus 
 
A little ditty bout Jack and Diane
Two American kids doin' the best they can
