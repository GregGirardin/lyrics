Street Player

I'll never forget those aimless years
Street sounds swirling through my mind
Trouble was often in the air
So we fought to forget our despair

  I'm a street player and I'll play you a song
  Cause you know my heart & soul will carry, carry on

City life's the only way
Street corners and billiard halls
was our home away lessons learned still help me today

I'm a street player and I've seen it all
Hit men thieves and many a brawl
But as you see I still stand tall

    It was such a small space in time
    I never knew that I would find
    A musical path for all to see anxiety to ecstasy

  I'm a street player...

Street player watch your groove
