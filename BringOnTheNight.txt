The afternoon has gently passed me by
The evening spreads its sail against the sky
Waiting for tomorrow, just another day
God bid yesterday good-bye

  Bring on the night I couldn't spend another hour of daylight x 2

The future is but a question mark
Hangs above my head, there in the dark
Cant see for the brightness is staring me blind
God bid yesterday good-bye

  Bring on the night...
