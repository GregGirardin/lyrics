Upside Down

Gm C F Gm
Bbm7

I said, upside down you're turning me
You're giving love instinctively
'round and 'round you're turning me.

  Upside down, boy, you turn me inside out and round and round x 2

Instinctively you give to me the love that I need
I cherish the moments with you
Respectfully I see to thee, I'm aware that you're cheating
But no one makes me feel like you do

I know you got charm and appeal, you always play the field
I'm crazy to think you are mine.
As long as the sun continues to shine
There's a place in my heart for you, that's the bottom line

Chorus

Upside down you're turning me you're giving love instinctively
'round and 'round you're turning me I say to thee, respectfully
Upside down you're turning me
