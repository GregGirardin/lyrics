Midnight, gettin uptight, where are you?
You said you'd meet me, now it's quarter to two
I know I'm hangin' but I'm still wantin' you

Hey Jack, it's a fact they're talkin' in town
I turn my back and you're messin' around
I'm not getting jealous, don't like lookin' like a clown

  I think of you every night and day
  You took my heart, and you took my pride away

  I hate myself for loving you
  Can't break free from the the things that you do
  I wanna walk but I run back to you
  That's why I hate myself for loving you

(Intro riff x 2)

Daylight, spent the night without you
But I've been dreamin' 'bout the lovin' you do
I'm over being angry 'bout the hell you put me through

Hey man, bet you can't treat me right
You just don't know what you was missin' last night
I wanna see you beggin', say, "Forget it" just for spite
