I need to Know

V: D
C: Em D C D
S: A Em A Em B

Well the talk on the street says you might go solo
A good friend of mine saw you leavin' by your back door

  I need to know..
  If you think you're gonna leave then you better say so
  I need to know
  'Cause I don't know how long, I can hold on
  If you're makin' me wait,
  If you're leadin' me on
  I need to know, (I need to know)

Who would've thought that you'd fall for his line
All of a sudden it's me on the outside

Chorus

Solo
