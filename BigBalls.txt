I'm rather upper class high society
God's gift to ballroom notoriety
And I always fill my ballrooms the event is never small
The social pages say I've got the biggest balls of all

  I've got big balls, I've got big balls
  They're such big balls, and they're fancy big balls
  And he's got big balls, and she's got big balls
  But we've got the biggest balls of them all

And my balls are always bouncing my ballroom always full
And everybody Comes and comes again
If your name is on the guest list no one can take you higher
Everybody says I've got great balls of fire!

  I've got big balls I've got big balls
  I've got big balls and there dirty big ball
  And he's got big balls and she's got big balls
  But we've got the biggest balls of them all

Some balls are held for charity and some for fancy dress
But when they're held for pleasure they're the balls that I like best
My balls are always bouncing to the left and to the right
It's my belief that my big balls should be held every night

  I've got big balls I've got big balls
  I've got big balls and they're such big balls
  And he's got big balls And she's got big balls
  But we've got the biggest balls of them all

And I'm just itching to tell you about them (we've got big balls)
Oh we had such wonderful fun (we've got big balls)
Seafood cocktail, crabs, crayfish... (we've got big balls of them all)
