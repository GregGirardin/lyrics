All things all at once

V: (Em Bm C)
C: (D C Em Bm) - (Em D C Am)

In those days we were lions / kings
It's not one thing or the other
It's all things all at once

  Oh I'll love you better than him x 4
  (3 Measures)
  ohhh x 2

These wings ain't for flying
These wings are just for show
It's years since I've been flying
I am down to the earth

  Oh I'll love you better than him x 4
  ohhh x 4

In those days we were lions / kings
