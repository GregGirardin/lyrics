Everlong

Dmaj7 Bsus2  Gsus2 Bsus2

Hello, I've waited here for you Everlong
Tonight I throw myself into
And out of the red, out of her head she sang

Come down and waste away with me down with me
Slow how you wanted it to be
I'm over my head, out of her head she sang

D A

     D
And I wonder
A               D
When I sing along with you

  B5                    G5                  D5
  If everything could ever feel this real forever
  If anything could ever be this good again
  The only thing I'll ever ask of you
                            A5               G5
  You've got to promise not to stop when I say when she sang

Breathe out so I could breathe you in hold you in
And now I know you've always been
Out of your head, out of my head I sang
