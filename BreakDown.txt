Break Down

V: (Am G) F  C: Am G F G
 
It's alright if you love me, it's aliright if you don't
I'm not afraid of you runnin away, honey I get the feelin you won'
 
There is no sense in pretending, your eyes give you away
Somethin' inside you is feelin like I do we've said all there is to say
Baby

  Break down go ahead and give it to me
  Break down honey take me through the night
  Break down I'm standin here can't you see
  Break down it's alrightâ€¦

Solo
