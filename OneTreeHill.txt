One Tree Hill

We turn away to face the cold, enduring chill
as the day begs the night for mercy love
The sun so bright it leaves no shadows
Only scars carved into stone on the face of earth
The moon is up and over One Tree Hill
We see the sun go down in your eyes

  You run like a river runs to the sea x 2

And in the world a heart of darkness a fire zone
Where poets speak their heart then bleed for it
Jara sang, his song a weapon in the hands of love
You know his blood still cries from the ground

  It runs like a river runs to the sea

I don't believe in painted roses or bleeding hearts
While bullets rape the night of the merciful
I'll see you again when the stars fall from the sky
And the moon has turned red over One Tree Hill

  We run like a river run to the sea

  And when it's raining raining hard
  That's when the rain will break my heart

  Raining...raining in the heart...
  To the sea

    Oh great ocean, oh great sea, run to the ocean, run to the sea
