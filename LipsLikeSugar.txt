She floats like a swan, grace on the water
Lips like sugar, lips like sugar
Just when you think you've caught her, she glides across the water
She calls for you tonight, to share this moonlight

  You'll flow down her river she'll ask you and you'll give her
  Lips like sugar sugar kisses x 2

She knows what she knows I know what she's thinking
Sugar kisses sugar kisses
Just when you think she's yours she's flown to other shores
To laugh at how you break and melt into this lake

  You'll flow down...
  Lips like sugar sugar kisses x 2

!Solo

She'll be my mirror reflect what I am
A loser and a winner the king of Siam
And my siamese twin alone on the river
Mirror kisses, mirror kisses

  Lips like sugar sugar kisses x 4
