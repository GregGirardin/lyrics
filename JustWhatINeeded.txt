Just What I Needed

V: E B C#m G# - E B G# A
I: E B C#m G# - E B C#m A
C: E B A C#m

I don’t mind you coming here wasting all my time
‘Cause when you’re standing oh so near I kind of lose my mind
It’s not the perfume that you wear It’s not the ribbons in your hair
I don’t mind you coming here And wasting all my time

I don’t mind you hanging out And talking in your sleep
It doesn’t matter where you’ve been As long as it was deep, yeah
You always knew to wear it well and You look so fancy I can tell
I don’t mind you hanging out And talking in your sleep
 
  I guess you’re just what I needed, I needed someone to feed
  I guess you’re just what I needed, I needed someone to bleed  
 
Solo
 
I don’t mind you coming here and wasting all my time, time
‘Cause when you’re standing oh so near I kind of lose my mind, yeah
It’s not the perfume that you wear It’s not the ribbons in your hair
I don’t mind you coming here And wasting all my time
 
Chorus x 2
 
 
So feed me
 
You’re just what I needed
