Our Lips Are Sealed (Moon Talk)

    Hush, my darling don't you cry.
    Quiet, angel, forget their lies.

Can you hear them? They talk about us.
Telling lies, well, that's no surprise.
Can you see them? See right through them.
They have no shields, no secrets to reveal.

  It doesn't matter what they say
  In the jealous games people play, our lips are sealed.

There's a weapon we must use
In our defense, silence.
When you look at them, look right through them,
That's when they'll disappear, that's when you'll be feared.

   It doesn't matter what they say
   In the jealous games people play. Our lips are sealed.
   Pay no mind to what they say
   It doesn't matter anyway, our lips are sealed.
