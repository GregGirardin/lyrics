Band On The Run

Dmaj7 G6, Dmaj7 Gm6

V: (DM7 - G) (DM7 Gm6)
(Am D6)

Stuck inside these four walls, sent inside forever,
Never seeing no one nice again like you mama, you mama you.

If I ever get out of here thought of giving it all away
To a registered charity all I need is a pint a day
If I ever get out of here

Well, the rain exploded with a mighty crash as we fell into the sun
And the first one said to the second one there I hope you're having fun.

  Band on the run, band on the run.
  And the jailer man and Sailor Sam were searching every one
  For the band on the run band on the run...

Well the undertaker drew a heavy sigh seeing no one else had come,
And a bell was ringing in the village square for the rabbits on the run.

Chorus

Well the night was falling as the desert world began to settle down.
In the town they're searching for us everywhere, but we never will be found.

Band on the run, band on the run
And the county judge, who held a grudge will search for evermore
Ya the band on the run..
