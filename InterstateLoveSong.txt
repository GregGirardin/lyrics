Interstate Love Song

Waiting on a Sunday afternoon
For what I read between the lines, your lies

Feelin' like a hand in rusted shame
So do you laugh at those who cry? Reply?

  Leavin' on a southern train only yesterday you lied,
  Promises of what I seemed to be
  Only watched the time go by
  All of these things you said to me

Breathing is the hardest thing to do
With all I've said and all that's dead for you, you lied, Good bye

!Chorus
