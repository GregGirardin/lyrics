Someone falls to pieces sleepin all alone someone kills the pain<br>
Spinning in the silence to finally drift away<br>
Someone gets excited in a chapel yard catches a bouquet<br>
Another lays a dozen white roses on a grave<br>

&nbsp&nbspTo be yourself is all that you can do x 2<br>

Someone finds salvation in everyone and another only pain<br>
Someone tries to hide himself down inside himself he prays<br>
Someone swears his true love until the end of time another runs away<br>

I got my first real six string. Bought it at the five-and-dime<br>
Played it til my fingers bled. It was the summer of 69<br>
Me and some guys from school had a band and we tried real hard<br>
Jimmy quit, Jody got married, I should've known we'd never get far<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspOh, when I look back now that summer seemed to last forever<br>
&nbsp&nbspAnd if I had the choice, yeah I'd always wanna be there<br>
&nbsp&nbspThose were the best days of my life<br>
<br>
Ain't no use in complaining when you've got a job to do<br>
Spent my evenings down at the drive-in and that's when I met you, yeah<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspStandin on your mama's porch you told me that you'd wait forever<br>
&nbsp&nbspOh, and when you held my hand I knew that it was now or never<br>
&nbsp&nbspThose were the best days of my life<br>
&nbsp&nbspOh, yeah, back in the summer of '69, oh.<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMan we were killing time we were young and restless we needed to unwind<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI guess nothing can last forever, forever<br>
<br>
And now the times are changing look at everything that's come and gone<br>
Sometimes when I play that old six-string I think about you, wonder what went wrong<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspStanding on your mama's porch you told me that it'd last forever<br>
&nbsp&nbspOh, and when you held my hand I knew that it was now or never<br>
&nbsp&nbspThose were the best days of my life<br>
<br>
Oh, yeah. back in the summer of '69, oh.<br>
It was the summer of '69, oh, yeah. Me and my baby in '69, oh.<br>

God it's so painful when something that's so close is still so far out of reach<br>

I remember when, I remember when I lost my mind<br>
There was something so pleasant about that place<br>
Even your emotions had an echo in so much space<br>
And when you're out there, without care, I was out of touch<br>

&nbsp&nbspDoes that make me crazy? Probably<br>
<br>
And I hope that you are having the time of your life<br>
But think twice, that's my only advice<br>
Come on now, who do you think you are<br>
Bless your soul. You really think you're in control<br>

My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on a limb<br>

Got to find a reason why my money's all gone<br>
I got a dalmatian, and I can still get high<br>
I can play the guitar like a motherfucking riot<br>
<br>
Well, life is too short, so love the one you got<br>
Cause you might get run over or you might get shot<br>
Never start no static I just get it off my chest<br>
Never had to battle with no bulletproof vest<br>
Take a small example, take a tip from me<br>
Take all of your money, give it all to charity<br>
<br>
Love is what I got, it's within my reach<br>
And the Sublime style's still straight from Long Beach<br>
It all comes back to you you'll finally get what you deserve<br>
Try and test that you're bound to get served<br>
Love's what I got don't start a riot<br>
You'll feel it when the dance gets hot<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspLovin', is what I got, I said remember that<br>
<br>
Why I don't cry when my dog runs away<br>
I don't get angry at the bills I have to pay<br>
I don't get angry when my mom smokes pot<br>
Hits the bottle and goes right to the rock<br>
Fuckin' and fightin it's all the same<br>
Livin' with Louie dog's the only way to stay sane<br>
Let the lovin' come back to me<br>
<br>

Well I don't know why I came here tonight I got the feeling that something ain't right<br>
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair and I'm wondering how I'll get down the stairs<br>
Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right, here I am, stuck in the middle with you.<br>

Yes I'm stuck in the middle with you and I'm wondering what it is I should do<br>
It's so hard to keep this smile from my face losing control, yeah, I'm all over the place..<br>
Clowns to the left..<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspWell you started out with nothing and you're proud that you're a self made man<br>
&nbsp&nbspAnd your friends they all come crawlin slap you on the back and say please, please<br>
<br>
Trying to make some sense of it all but I can see that it makes no sense at all<br>
Is it cool to go to sleep on the floor cause I don't think that I can take anymore.<br>

I'm rather upper class high society<br>
God's gift to ballroom notoriety<br>
And I always fill my ballrooms the event is never small<br>
The social pages say I've got the biggest balls of all<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspI've got big balls, I've got big balls<br>
&nbsp&nbspThey're such big balls, and they're fancy big balls<br>
&nbsp&nbspAnd he's got big balls, and she's got big balls<br>
&nbsp&nbspBut we've got the biggest balls of them all<br>
<br>
And my balls are always bouncing my ballroom always full<br>
And everybody comes and comes again<br>
If your name is on the guest list no one can take you higher<br>
Everybody says I've got great balls of fire!<br>

&nbsp&nbspI've got big balls I've got big balls<br>

Some balls are held for charity and some for fancy dress<br>
But when they're held for pleasure they're the balls that I like best<br>
My balls are always bouncing to the left and to the right<br>
It's my belief that my big balls should be held every night<br>

Take a minute to concentrate and she opens up her eyes<br>
