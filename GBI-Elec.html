On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair<br>
Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air<br>
Up ahead in the distance I saw a shimmering light<br>
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim I had to stop for the night<br>
<br>
There she stood in the doorway, I heard the mission bell<br>
And I was thinking to myself, "This could be heaven or this could be hell"<br>
Then she lit up a candle, and she showed me the way<br>
There were voices down the corridor, I thought I heard them say<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspWelcome to the Hotel California such a lovely place, such a lovely face<br>
&nbsp&nbspPlenty of room at the Hotel California any time of year, you can find it here<br>
<br>
Her mind is Tiffany twisted, she got the Mercedes Benz<br>
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, she calls friends<br>
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat<br>
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget<br>
<br>
So I called up the Captain, "Please&nbsp&nbsp&nbsping me my wine"<br>
He said, "We haven't had that spirit here since 1969"<br>
And still those voices are calling from far away<br>
Wake you up in the middle of the night, just to hear them say<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspWelcome to the Hotel California such a lovely place, such a lovely face<br>
&nbsp&nbspThey living it up at the Hotel California what a nice surprise,&nbsp&nbsp&nbsping your alibis<br>
<br>
Mirrors on the ceiling, pink champagne on ice<br>
And she said: "We are all just prisoners here, of our own device"<br>
And in the master's chambers they gathered for the feast<br>
They stab it with their steely knives but they just can't kill the beast<br>
<br>
Last thing I remember, I was running for the door<br>
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before<br>
"Relax" said the night man "We are programmed to receive<br>
you can check out any time you like but you can never leave"<br>

I got my first real six string. Bought it at the five-and-dime<br>
Played it til my fingers bled. It was the summer of 69<br>
Me and some guys from school had a band and we tried real hard<br>
Jimmy quit, Jody got married, I should've known we'd never get far<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspOh, when I look back now that summer seemed to last forever<br>
&nbsp&nbspAnd if I had the choice, yeah I'd always wanna be there<br>
&nbsp&nbspThose were the best days of my life<br>
<br>
Ain't no use in complaining when you've got a job to do<br>
Spent my evenings down at the drive-in and that's when I met you, yeah<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspStandin on your mama's porch you told me that you'd wait forever<br>
&nbsp&nbspOh, and when you held my hand I knew that it was now or never<br>

&nbsp&nbspOh, yeah, back in the summer of '69, oh.<br>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMan we were killing time we were young and restless we needed to unwind<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI guess nothing can last forever, forever<br>
<br>
And now the times are changing look at everything that's come and gone<br>
Sometimes when I play that old six-string I think about you, wonder what went wrong<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspStanding on your mama's porch you told me that it'd last forever<br>
&nbsp&nbspOh, and when you held my hand I knew that it was now or never<br>
&nbsp&nbspThose were the best days of my life<br>
<br>
Oh, yeah. back in the summer of '69, oh.<br>

Yeah, she could hear the cars roll by, out on 441 like waves crashin' on the beach<br>

God it's so painful when something that's so close is still so far out of reach<br>

I remember when, I remember when I lost my mind<br>
There was something so pleasant about that place<br>
&nbsp&nbspeven your emotions had an echo in so much space<br>
And when you're out there, without care, I was out of touch<br>
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough I just knew too much<br>

&nbsp&nbspDoes that make me crazy? Probably<br>
<br>
And I hope that you are having the time of your life<br>
But think twice, that's my only advice<br>
Come on now, who do you think you are<br>
Bless your soul. You really think you're in control<br>

Has our conscience shown? Has the sweet breeze blown?<br>
Has all kindness gone? Hope still lingers on.<br>

&nbsp&nbspI drink myself of new found pity sitting alone in New York City<br>

Are we listening? Hymns of offering.<br>
Have we eyes to see? Love is gathering.<br>

Early in the morning, risin' to the street<br>
Light me up that cigarette and I strap shoes on my feet<br>
Got to find a reason, a reason things went wrong<br>
Got to find a reason why my money's all gone<br>
I got a dalmatian, and I can still get high<br>
I can play the guitar like a motherfucking riot<br>
<br>
Well, life is too short, so love the one you got<br>
Cause you might get run over or you might get shot<br>
Never start no static I just get it off my chest<br>
Never had to battle with no bulletproof vest<br>
Take a small example, take a tip from me<br>
Take all of your money, give it all to charity<br>
<br>
Love is what I got, it's within my reach<br>
And the Sublime style's still straight from Long Beach<br>
It all comes back to you you'll finally get what you deserve<br>
Try and test that you're bound to get served<br>
Love's what I got don't start a riot<br>
You'll feel it when the dance gets hot<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbspLovin', is what I got, I said remember that<br>
<br>
Why I don't cry when my dog runs away<br>
I don't get angry at the bills I have to pay<br>
I don't get angry when my mom smokes pot<br>
Hits the bottle and goes right to the rock<br>
Fuckin' and fightin it's all the same<br>
Livin' with Louie dog's the only way to stay sane<br>
Let the lovin' come back to me<br>

I read the news today oh boy about a lucky man who made the grade<br>
And though the news was rather sad well I just had to laugh<br>
I saw the photograph<br>
<br>
He blew his mind out in a car he didn't notice that the lights had changed<br>
A crowd of people stood and stared they'd seen his face before<br>
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords<br>
<br>
I saw a film today oh boy the English army had just won the war<br>
A crowd of people turned away but I just had to look having read the book.<br>
I'd love to turn you on<br>
--!><br>
&nbsp&nbspWoke up, fell out of bed, dragged a comb across my head<br>
&nbsp&nbspFound my way downstairs and drank a cup and looking up, I noticed I was late<br>
&nbsp&nbspFound my coat and grabbed my hat, made the bus in seconds flat<br>
&nbsp&nbspFound my way upstairs and had a smoke and somebody spoke and I went into a dream<br>
&nbsp&nbspAhhh..<br>
<br>
I read the news today oh boy, four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire<br>
And though the holes were rather small they had to count them all<br>
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall<br>
I'd love to turn you on<br>

Sometimes when this place gets kind of empty the sound of their voice fades with the light<br>
I think about the loveless fascination under the Milky Way tonight<br>

Lower the curtains down on Memphis lower the curtains down alright<br>
I've got no time for private consultation under the Milky Way tonight<br>

&nbsp&nbspWish I knew what you were looking for<br>
&nbsp&nbspMight have known what you would find<br>

And it's something quite peculiar something that's shimmering and white<br>
It leads you here despite your destination under the Milky Way tonight<br>

Oh, but now it's so much better I'm funking out in every way<br>
But I'll never lose that feeling Of how I learned my lesson that day<br>

Baby, I could never steal you from another<br>
It's such a shame our friendship had to end<br>

It's time we all reach out for something new, that means you too<br>
You say you want a leader but you can't seem to make up your mind<br>

You're wearing out things that nobody wears<br>
You're calling my name but I gotta make clear<br>
I can't say baby where I'll be in a year<br>

When some sweet hog mama with a face like a gent<br>
Said my get up and go must've got up and went<br>
Well I got good news, she's a real good liar<br>
Cause the backstage boogie set your pants on fire<br>

I pulled into town in a police car<br>
Your daddy said I took it just a little too far<br>
You're telling me things but your girlfriend lied<br>
You can't catch me cause the rabbit done died, yes it did<br>
<br>
You stand in the front just a shakin your ass<br>
I'll take you backstage you can drink from my glass<br>
I'll talk about something you can sure understand<br>

So, so you think you can tell, heaven from hell, blue skies from pain<br>
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail, a smile from a veil<br>
Do you think you can tell?<br>

Did they get you to trade, your heroes for ghosts hot ashes for trees<br>
Hot air for a cool breeze, cold comfort for change<br>
And did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage<br>
<br>
How I wish, how I wish you were here<br>

Looking back on when I was a little nappy headed boy.<br>
Then my only worry was for Christmas what would be my toy.<br>
&nbsp&nbspEven though we sometimes would not get a thing<br>
&nbsp&nbspWe were happy with the joy the day would bring<br>
<br>
Sneaking out the back door, to hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine.<br>
Greeted at the back door with "boy, I thought I told you not to go outside?"<br>
&nbsp&nbspTryin your best to bring the water to you eyes.<br>
&nbsp&nbspThinkin it might stop her from whoopin your behind.<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI wish those days could come back once more,<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWhy did those days ever have to go? Cos I love them so.<br>

&nbsp&nbspDo do do do<br>

Brother says he's tellin bout you playing doctor with that girl.<br>
Just don't tell I'll give you anything you want in this whole wide world.<br>
&nbsp&nbspMama gives you money, for Sunday school<br>
&nbsp&nbspYou trade yours for candy after church is through.<br>
<br>
Smokin cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall (you nasty boy!)<br>
Teacher sends you to the principal's office down the hall.<br>
