Something About You

I: (E C D E)   V: E C#m D Bm7 E   P: E C D

How, how can it be that a love carved out of caring
Fashioned by fate could suffer so hard
From the games played once too often
But making mistakes is a part of life's imperfections
Born of the years is it so wrong to be human after all

  Drawn into the stream of undefined illusion
  Those diamond dreams they can't disguise the truth

  That there is something about you, baby, so right
  I wouldn't be without you, baby, tonight

If ever our love was concealed no one can say that we didn't feel
A million things and a perfect dream of life
Gone, fragile but free we remain tender together
If not so in love it's not so wrong we're only human after all

  These changing years they add to your confusion
  Oh and you need to hear the time that told the truth

  Because there's something about you, baby, so right
  I couldn't live without you, baby, tonight
  And that there's something about you yeah
  And I couldn't live without you tonight
