We're talking away well i dont know what im to say
Ill say it anyway today's another day to find you
Shying away I'll be coming for your love, ok?

  Take on me, Take me on, Ill be gone in a day or two

So needless to say I'm odds and ends, but ill be
Stumbling away slowly learning that life is ok
Say after me Its no better to be safe than sorry

Oh, the things that you say yeah, is it life or just to play
My worries away? You're all the things ive got to remember
You're shying away I'll be coming for you anyway
