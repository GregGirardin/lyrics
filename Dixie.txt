Oh, I wish I was in the land of cotton, Old times there are not forgotten,
Look away, look away, look away Dixie Land.

In Dixie Land, where I was born in, early on one frosty mornin', 
Look away, look away, look away Dixie Land. 
 
  I wish I was in Dixie, Hooray! Hooray! In Dixie Land I'll take my stand to live and die in Dixie. 
  Away, away, away down south in Dixie. 

Ole Missus marry "Will the weaver" Willum was a gay deceiver
 
But when he put his arm around 'er, He smiled fierce as a forty pounder,
 
His face was sharp as a butcher's cleaver But that did not seem to grieve 'er
 
Ole Missus acted the foolish part And died for a man that broke her heart
 
Now here's a health to the next ole Missus An' all the gals that want to kiss us;
 
But if you want to drive 'way sorrow Come and hear this song tomorrow
 
There's buckwheat cakes and Injun batter, Makes you fat or a little fatter;
 
Then hoe it down and scratch your gravel, To Dixie's Land I'm bound to travel,
