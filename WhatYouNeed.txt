What You Need

Hey, here is the story forget about the trouble in life
Don't you know, it's not easy when you gotta walk upon that line

  That's why, you need
  That's why, this is what you need
  I'll give you what you need

Solo

Don't you get sad and lonely you need a change from what you do all day
Ain't no sense in all your crying just pick it up and throw it into shape

Chorus
Solo

Hey you, won't you listen this is not the end of it all
Don't you see there is a rhythm I'll take you where you really need to be
