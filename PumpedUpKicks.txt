Pumped Up Kicks

V: Fm Ab Eb Bb

Robert's got a quick hand, he'll look around the room he won't tell you his plan
Got a rolled cigarette, hangin' out his mouth, he's a cowboy kid
Yeah, found a six-shooter gun, in his dads closet hidden with a box of fun things
I don't even know what, but he's comin' for you, yeah he's comin for you, hey

  All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
  You'd better run, better run outrun my gun
  All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
  You'd better run, better run faster than my bullet

Daddy works a long day, he'll be coming home late he's coming home late
And he's bringing me a surprise, cos dinner's in the kitchen and it's packed in ice
I've waited for a long time, the slight of my hand is now a quick pull trigger
I reason with my cigarette, and say your hair's on fire you must have lost your wits, yeah

Chorus

  (run run run)
