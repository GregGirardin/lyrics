Mother told me, yes she told me I’d meet girls like you
She also told me stay away You’ll never know what you’ll catch
Just the other day I heard Of a soldier’s falling off
Some Indonesian junk That’s going ‘round
 
  Mommy’s alright, Daddy’s alright they just seem a little weird
  Surrender, surrender but don’t give yourself away
 
 A - B
 
Father says your mother's right she's really up on things
Before we married Mommy served in the WACs in the Philippines
Now I had heard the WACs recruited old maids for the war
But Mommy isn't one of those I've known her all these years

Chorus

Whatever happened to all this season's losers of the year
Every time I got to thinking where'd they disappear
Then I woke up, Mom and Dad are rolling on the couch
Rolling numbers, rock and rolling got my Kiss records out
 
Chorus
