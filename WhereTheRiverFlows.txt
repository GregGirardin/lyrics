Where The River Flows

Give me a moment got to get this weight up off my chest
Don't feed me sorrow pain is a poison I digest

  Find yourself another soul to hold - You think, you thought, I know
  Off upon my journey I must go
  To where the river flows

I'll give you answers to the questions you have yet to ask
Silence is beauty words they only complicate the task

c!

s!

Make no more wishes all of my patience has been spent
Gods of the season lead me to my next incident
