Don't Fear The Reaper

V: (Am G F G) F G Am - F E Am (G Am) (Am G F G)

All our times have. Home here but now they're gone
Seasons don't fear the reaper
Nor do the wind, the sun or the rain..we can be like they are
  Come on baby... <i>don't fear the reaper</i>
  Baby take my hand
  We'll be able to fly
  Baby I'm your man...

La la...

Valentine is done. Here but now they're gone
Romeo and Juliet are together in eternity...Romeo and Juliet</i>
40,000 men and women everyday...<i>Like Romeo and Juliet</i>
40,000 men and women everyday...<i>Redefine happiness</i>
Another 40,000 coming everyday...<i>We can be like they are</i>

Come on baby...<i>don't fear the reaper</i>
Baby take my hand.
We'll be able to fly.
Baby I'm your man...
La la la la

Love of two is one. Here but now they're gone
Came the last night of sadness
And it was clear she couldn't go on
Then the door was open and the wind appeared
The candles blew then disappeared
The curtains flew then he appeared...saying don't be afraid

Come on baby...<i>and she had no fear</i>
And she ran to him...<i>then they started to fly</i>
They looked backward and said goodby...<i>she had become like they are</i>
She had taken his hand...<i>she had become like they are</i>
Come on baby...<i>don't fear the reaper</i> . . .
