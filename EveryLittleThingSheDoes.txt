Though I've tried before to tell her
of the feelings I have for her in my heart
Every time that I come near her
I just loose my nerves as I've done from the start

  Every little thing she does is magic
  Every thing she do just turns me on
  Even though my love before was tragic
  Now I know my love for her goes on

Do I have to tell the story of a thousand rainy days since we first met
It's a big enough umbrella but it's always me who ends up getting wet

Chorus

  I resolved to call her up a thousand times a day
  And ask her if she'll marry me in some old fashioned way
  But my silent fears have gripped me, long before I reach the phone
  Long before my tongue has tripped me, must I always be alone

Chorus x 2

Every little thing
Every little, every little, every little every little  is magic
Eee oh oh...
