Stand by me

A F#m D E

When the night has come and the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we'll see
No, I won't be afraid  I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand Stand by me

  So darlin darlin stand by me...

If the sky that we look upon should tumble and fall
Or the mountain should crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry no, I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand stand by me

!Chorus
