Cant Get Enough

V: C Bb F  Bb F
C: G Bb F  Eb - (C F) - G C G

Well I take whatever I want and baby I want you
You give me something I need Now tell me I got something for you
Come on come on come on and do it Come on and do what you do

  I can't get enough of your love

Well it's late and I want love Love that's gonna break me in two
Don't hang me up in your doorway Don't hang me up like you do
Come on come on come on and do it Come on and do what you do

  I can't get enough of your love

Solo
