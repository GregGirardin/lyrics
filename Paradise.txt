Paradise

I'd wash the sand off the shore, give you the world if it was mine
Blow you right to my door, feels fine
Feels like you're mine, feels right so fine
I'm yours you're mine like paradise

I'd give you the world if it was mine, feels fine
Feels like you're mine
I'm yours so fine like paradise

Ooh, what a life..
I wanna share my life
Wanna share my life with you
