Cumbersome

She calls me Goliath and I wear the David mask
I guess the stones are coming too fast for her now
You know I'd like to believe this nervousness will pass
All the stones that are thrown are building up the wall

  I have become cumbersome to this world / to my girl

I'd like to believe we could reconcile the past
Resurrect those bridges with an ancient glance
But my old stone face can't seem to break her down
She remembers bridges, burns them to the ground.

!Chorus

    Too heavy too light too black or too white too wrong or too right
    Today or tonight Cumbersome
    Too rich or too poor she's wanting me less and I'm wanting her more
    A bitter taste is cumbersome

      There is a balance between two worlds one with an arrow and a cross
      Regardless of the balance life has become cumbersome

  Too heavy..

Your life has become cumbersome
