Time Has Come Today

D C G D

Time has come today, young hearts can go their way
Can't put it off another day, I don't care what others say
They say we don't listen anyway, time has come today

The rules have changed today, I have no place to stay (Hey)
I'm thinking about the subway, my love has flown away
My tears have come and gone, oh my Lord, I have to roam
I have no home, I have no home

Intro

Now the time has come, there's no place to run (Time)
I might get burned up by the sun, but I had my fun
I've been loved and put aside, I've been crushed by the tumbling tide
And my soul has been psychedelicized
Now the time has come, there are things to realize
Time has come today, time has come today
Time...

Now the time has come, there's no place to run
I might get burned up by the sun, but I had my fun
I've been loved and put aside, I've been crushed by the tumbling tide
And my soul has been psychedelicized

Now the time has come, there are things to realize
Time has come today
Time...
