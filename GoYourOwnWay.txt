Go Your Own way
 
V: ( F C Bb - Bb F )
C: Dm Bb C

Loving you, isn't the right thing to do?
How can I, ever change things that I feel
If I could, maybe I'd give you my world
How can I, when you won't take it from me?
 
  You can go your own way, go your own way
  You can call it another lonely day
  You can go your own way, go your own way
 
Tell me why, everything turned around?
Packing up, shacking up is all you wanna do.
If I could, baby I'd give you my world.
Open up, everything's waiting for you.
