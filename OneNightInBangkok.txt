One Night In Bangkok

V: Dm C/D Dm C/D Dm Gm7
C: Dm Bb F Dm - Gm C Gm7

Bangkok, Oriental setting but the city don't know that the city is getting
The creme de la creme of the chess world in a show with everything but Yul Brynner
Time flies doesn't seem a minute since the Tirolean spa had the chess boys in it
All changed don't you know that when you play at this level there's no ordinary venue

It's Iceland or the Philippines or Hastings or or this place!

  One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster the bars are temples but the pearls ain't free
  You'll find a god in every golden cloister and if you're lucky then the god's a she
  I can feel an angel sliding up to me

One town's very like another when your head's down over your pieces, brother
  It's a drag, it's a bore, it's really such a pity
  To be looking at the board not looking at the city
Whaddya mean? Ya seen one crowded, polluted, stinking town
  Tea, girls, warm, sweet some are set up in the Somerset Maugham suite
Get Thai'd You're talking to a tourist whose every move's among the purest
I get my kicks above the waistline, sunshine

  One night in Bangkok makes a hard man humble not much between despair and ecstasy
  One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble can't be too careful with your company
  I can feel the devil walking next to me

!Solo

Siam's gonna be the witness to the ultimate test of cerebral fitness
This grips me more than would a muddy old river or reclining Buddha
And thank God I'm only watching the game controlling it
I don't see you guys rating the kind of mate I'm contemplating
I'd let you watch I would invite you but the queens we use would not excite you
So you better go back to your bars, your temples, your massage parlours
