Mysterious Ways

Johnny take a walk with your sister the moon
Let her pale light in to fill up your room
You've been living underground eating from a can
You've been running away from what you don't understand, love

  She's slippy you're sliding down she'll be there when you hit the ground
  It's alright.. she moves in mysterious ways

Johnny take a dive with your sister in the rain
Let her talk about the things you can't explain
To touch is to heal to hurt is to steal
If you want to kiss the sky better learn how to kneel, on your knees boy!

  She's the wave she turns the tide she sees the man inside the child...
  Lift my days, light up my nights, oh

!Solo

    One day you'll look back and you'll see where you were held low
    By this love while you could stand there
    You could move on this moment follow this feeling

!Chorus / Solo
