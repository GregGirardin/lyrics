No Matter What

V: A Bm (D E) A   C: F#m B7 E A D Bm [G] A

No matter what you are I will always be with you
Doesn't matter what you do girl, ooh girl with you
No matter what you do I will always be around
Won't you tell me what you found girl, ooh girl, want you

  Knock down the old grey wall, be a part of it all
  Nothing to say, nothing to see, nothing to do
  If you would give me all, as I would give it to you
  Nothing would be, nothing would be, nothing would be

No matter where you go there will always be a place
Can't you see it in my face girl, ooh girl, want you

Solo

  Knock down the old grey wall...
