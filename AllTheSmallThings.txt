All the small things true care, truth brings
I'll take one lift your ride best trip
Always I know you'll be at my show Watching, waiting, commiserating

  Say it ain't so, I will not go,
  Turn the lights off, carry me home
  Na, na...

Solo

Late night come home work sucks I know
She left me roses by the stairs
Surprises, let me know she cares

Chorus / Break / Chorus

 Keep your head still I'll be your thrill,
 The night will go on, my little windmill

  Say it ain't so, I will not go,
  Turn the lights off, carry me home
  Keep your head still  I'll be your thrill,
  The night will go on, the night will go on,
  My little windmill
