If you're havin trouble with the high school head he's givin you the blues (w/ ha)
You wanna graduate but not in his bed, here's what you gotta do
Pick up the phone I'm always home call me any time
Just ring 362436 oh I lead a life of crime

  Dirty deeds, done dirt cheap x 3 / Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap x 2

You've got problems in your life of love, you got a broken heart
He's double dealin with your best friend, that's when the teardrops start fella
Pick up the phone I'm here alone, I'll make a social call
Come right in forget 'bout him we'll have ourselves a ball

!Chorus

!Solo

If you got a lady and you want her gone but you ain't got the guts
She keeps naggin at you night and day, enough to drive you nuts
Pick up the phone leave her alone, it's time you made a stand
For a fee I'm happy to be your back door man hey

!Chorus

  Concrete shoes, cyanide, TNT - Done Dirt Cheap
   Neck ties, contracts, high voltage - Done Dirty Cheap

Dirty deeds, do anything you want me to
