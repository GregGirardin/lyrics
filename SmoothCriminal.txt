Smooth Criminal

As he came into the window was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment he left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table he could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom she was struck down, it was her doom

  Annie, are you okay? So Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie? x 4

  Annie, are you okay? Will you tell us that you're okay?
  There's a sound at the window then he struck you a crescendo, Annie
  He came into your apartment left the bloodstains on the carpet
  And then you ran into the bedroom you were struck down It was your doom

  Annie, are you okay? So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie? x 4

  You've been hit by, you've been hit by a smooth criminal

So they came into the outway it was Sunday, what a black day
Every time I tried to find him there were no clues, they’re behind him
And they end up never knowing who’s the suspect or what to expect
Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation sounding heartbeats, intimidations

Chorus

Solo
