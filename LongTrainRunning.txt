Long Train Running

V: Em - Am - Em - C B4 B Em

Down around the corner, half a mile from here
see them long trains running, and watch them disappear
Without love, where would you be now? Without love.
 
You know I saw Miss Lucy down along the tracks
She lost her home and her family and she won't be coming back
Without love, where would you be now? Without love.
 
Well, the Illinois Central and the Southern Central Freight 
Gotta keep on pushing mama you know they're running late
Without love, where would you be now? Without love.
 
Well, the Illinois Central...
 
Well the pistons keep on turning and the wheels go round and round.
The steel rails are cold and hard for the miles that they go down.
Without love, where would you be now? Without love.
