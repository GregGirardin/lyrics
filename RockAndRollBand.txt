Rock and Roll Band
 
Well  we were just another band out of Boston on the road to try to make ends meet
Playin all the bars, sleepin' in our cars And we practiced right on out in the street
No, we didn't have much money we barely made enough to survive
But when we got up on stage and got ready to play, people came alive. 
 
  Rock and roll band, everybody's waitin, gettin crazy, anticipating
  Love, and music, play, play, play, yeah...
 
Dancin' in the streets of Hyannis we were getting pretty good at the game
People stood in line and didn't seem to mind you know everybody knew our name
Livin' on rock-n-roll music never worry 'bout the things we were missing
When we got up on the stage and got ready to play, everybody'd listen.
 
Playin' for a week in Rhode Island a man came to the stage one night
He smoked a big cigar, Drove a Cadillac car and said, "Boys, I think this bands outta-sight
Sign a record company contract you know I've got great expectations
When I hear you on the car radio you're goin' to be a sensation!"
