The Unforgettable Fire

V: (Am - F) (C G Bb F) 2:(Dm E)

Ice, your only rivers run cold
These city lights they shine in silver and gold
Dug from the night your eyes as black as coal
  Walk on by, walk on through, walk till you run
  And don't look back, for here I am

Carnival, the wheels fly and the colors spin through alcohol
Red wine that punctures the skin
Face to face, in a dry and waterless place
  Walk on by, walk on through, so sad to besiege your love so head on
  Stay tonight, stay tonight in a lie
  I'm only asking but I think you know
  Come on take me away..
  Come on take me home, home again

And if the mountain should crumble or disappear into the sea
Not a tear no not I
  Stay in this time, stay tonight in a lie
  Ever after there's love in time
  And if you save it all, save your love
  Don't push me too far... tonight
