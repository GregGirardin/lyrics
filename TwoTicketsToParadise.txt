Two Tickets To Paradise
 
V: G A
C: D G A

Got a suprise, especially for you.
Something that both of us, have always wanted to do.
Waited so long...
 
I'm gonna take you on a trip so far from here.
I've got two tickets in my pocket, now baby, we're gonna disappear.
Waited so long..
 
  I've got, two tickets to paradise.
  Won't you, pack your bags, we'll leave tonight.
  I've got, two tickets to paradise.
  I've got, two tickets to paradise.
 
Solo

    oh-oh...
 
I'm gonna take you on a trip so far from here.
I've got two tickets in my pocket, baby, gonna disappear. (Know why?)
Waited so long, waited so long.
 
[Chorus]
