Pride

V: G C F D   S: G Bb C

One man come in the name of love, one man come and go
One man come he to justify, one man to overthrow

  In the name of love, what more in the name of love?

One man caught on a barbed wire fence, one man he resist
One man washed up on an empty beach, one man betrayed with a kiss

!Chorus
!Solo

Early morning, April 4 a shot rings out in the Memphis sky
Free at last, they took your life they could not take your pride

!Chorus
