Christmas Time

Christmas time is here happiness and cheer
Fun for all that children call
Their favorite time of the year
Snowflakes in the air carols everywhere
Olden times and  ancient rhymes
Of   love and dreams to share

  Sleigh bells in the air, beauty everywhere
  Yuletide by the fireside And joyful memories there

Christmas time is here we'll be drawing near
Oh, that we could always see such spirit through the year

Christmas time is here, we'll be drawing near
Oh, that we could always see such spirit through the year
