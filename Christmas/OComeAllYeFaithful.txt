God of God, Light of Light eternal,
Lo! he abhors not the Virgin's womb;
Son of the Father, begotten, not created,
O come, let us adore him...

O Sing, choirs of angels, sing in exultation,
Sing all ye citizens of Heaven above
Glory to God in the Highest;
O come, let us adore Him..

All Hail! Lord, we greet Thee, born this happy morning,
O Jesu!Solo for evermore be Thy name adored.
Word of the Father, now in flesh appearing;
O come, let us adore Him...
