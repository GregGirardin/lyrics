Silent Night

G                         D7           G
Silent night, holy night, all is calm, all is bright
C                 G                 C              G
Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child, holy infant so tender and mild
D7                G               D7       G
Sleep in heavenly peace, sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night, holy night, shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar, heavenly hosts sing Alleluia
Christ the Savior is born, Christ the Savior is born

Silent night, holy night, Son of God, love's pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face, with the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus Lord, at Thy birth, Jesus Lord, at Thy birth
