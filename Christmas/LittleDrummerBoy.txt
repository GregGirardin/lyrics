Come they told me, pa rum pa pum pum
Our newborn King to see, pa rum pa pum pum

Our finest gifts we bring, pa rum pa pum pum
         G                 C
To lay before the King, pa rum pa pum pum,
G               D
Rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum,
G                   C          G    D       G
So to honor Him, pa rum pa pum pum, when we come...

Little Baby, pa rum pa pum pum
I am a poor boy too, pa rum pa pum pum
I have no gift to bring, pa rum pa pum pum
To lay before the King, pa rum pa pum pum,
Rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum,
Shall I play for you, pa rum pa pum pum, on my drum?

Mary nodded, pa rum pa pum pum
The ox and lamb kept time, pa rum pa pum pum
I played my drums for Him, pa rum pa pum pum
I played my best for Him, pa rum pa pum pum
Rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum
Then He smiled at me, pa rum pa pum pum me and my drum
