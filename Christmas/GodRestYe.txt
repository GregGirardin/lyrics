God Rest Ye

(Em C B7) Am G Em D - G B7 Em D

God rest you merry, gentlemen, let nothing you dismay
For Jesus Christ our Saviour was born upon this day
To save us all from Satan's pow'r when we were gone astray

  O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy
  O tidings of comfort and joy

From God our heavenly Father a blessed angel came
And unto certain shepherds brought tidings of the same
How that in Bethlehem was born the Son of God by name

  Chorus

The shepherds at those tidings rejoiced much in mind
And left their flocks a-feeding in tempest, storm and wind
And went to Bethlehem straightway this blessed Babe to find

  Chorus

But when to Bethlehem they came whereat this Infant lay
They found Him in a manger where oxen feed on hay
His mother Mary kneeling unto the Lord did pray

  Chorus

Now to the Lord sing praises, all you within this place
And with true love and brotherhood each other now embrace
This holy tide of Christmas all other doth deface

  Chorus
