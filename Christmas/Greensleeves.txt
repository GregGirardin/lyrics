What Child Is This

     Am       C        G       Em      Am     F      E
What child is this who laid to rest on Mary's lap is sleeping?
     Am     C          G       Em           Am        E         Am
Whom Angels greet with anthems sweet, while shepherds watch are keeping?
  C             G          Em         Am        F         E
  This, this is Christ the King, whom shepherds guard and angels sing;
  C                G         Em          Am        E      Am
  Haste, haste, to bring Him praise, the Babe, the Son of Mary.

Why lies He in such mean estate, where ox and ass are feeding?
Good Christians, fear, for sinners here the silent Word is pleading.
  Nails, spear shall pierce Him through, the cross be borne for me, for you.
  Hail, hail the Word made flesh, the Babe, the Son of Mary.

So bring Him incense, gold and myrrh, come peasant, king to own Him
The King of kings salvation brings, let loving hearts enthrone Him.
  Raise, raise a song on high, the virgin sings her lullaby.
  Joy, joy for Christ is born, the Babe, the Son of Mary.
