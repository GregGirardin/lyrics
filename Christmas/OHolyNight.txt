O Holy Night

O holy night, the stars are brightly shining;
                       G    G7       C
It is the night of the dear Savior's birth!
C                     F             C
Long lay the world in sin and error pining,
          Em             B7            Em
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth.
  G         G7        C
A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices,
    G      G7       C                      G/B
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.

  Am           Em       Dm             Am      G/B
  Fall on your knees, O hear the angel voice!Solo
    C  G7   C F     C  G7                 C
  O night divine, O night when Christ was born!
    G  G7   C F      C  G7            F   C
  O night divine!, O night, O night divine!

Led by the light of faith serenely beaming,
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.
So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming,
Here came the wise men from Orient land.
The King of kings lay thus in lowly manger,
In all our tri-als born to be our Friend!

  He knows our need, to our weakness is no stranger!
  Be-ho...ld your King, before Him lowly bend!
  Be-ho...ld your King, before Him lowly bend!

Truly He taught us to love one another;
His law is love and His Gospel is peace.
Chains shall He break, for the slave is our brother
And in His name all oppression shall cease.
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
Let all within us praise His holy name!

  Christ is the Lord! Oh, praise His name for-ever!
  His pow'r and glory e...ver-more proclaim!
  His pow'r and glory e...ver-more proclaim!
