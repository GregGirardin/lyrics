California Dreamin'

I: Am E4
V: [ Am /G F G E ] F C E7 Am F E
S: Am... F ะก E7 Am F E  (Am /G F G E4 E)

All the leaves are brown and the sky is gray
I've been for a walk on a winter's day
I'd be safe and warm If I was in LA

  California dreamin' on such a winter's day

Stopped in to a church I passed along the way
Well I got down on my knees and I pretend to pray
You know the preacher likes the cold
He knows I'm gonna stay

!Chorus / !Solo / chorus / V1 / !Chorus
