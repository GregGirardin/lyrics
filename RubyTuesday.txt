O: Am G F G C

She would never say where she came from
Yesterday don't matter if it's gone
While the sun is bright or in the darkest night
No one knows, she comes and goes

  Good-bye Ruby Tuesday who could hang a name on you
  When you change with every new day still I'm gonna miss you

Don't question why she needs to be so free
Sheâ€™ll tell you it's the only way to be
She just can't be chained to a life where nothing gained
And nothing's lost, at such a cost

!Chorus

There's no time to lose I heard her say
Catch your dreams before they slip away
Dying all the time lose your dreams and you
will lose your mind ain't life unkind

!Chorus
