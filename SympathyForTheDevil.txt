Sympathy For the Devil

V: (E D A)   C: B E - B A E

Please allow me to introduce myself I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long year stole many a man's soul and faith
And I was 'round when Jesus Christ had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate washed his hands and sealed his fate

  Pleased to meet you hope you guess my name
  But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game

I stuck around St. Petersburg when I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the Czar and his ministers anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank held a general's rank
When the Blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank

Chorus

I watched with glee while your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades for the Gods they made
I shouted out "Who killed the Kennedys?"
When after all it was you and me
Let me please introduce myself I'm a man of wealth and taste
And I laid traps for troubadours who get killed before they reached Bombay

Chorus / Solo / Chorus

Just as every cop is a criminal and all the sinners saints
As heads is tails just call me Lucifer cCause I'm in need of some restraint
So if you meet me have some courtesy have some sympathy, and some taste
Use all your well-learned politesse or I'll lay your soul to waste, um yeah

Chorus

Woo, who
Tell me baby, what's my name
Tell me honey, baby guess my name
Tell me baby, what's my name
I tell you one time, you're to blame
