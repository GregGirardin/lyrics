Good

V: G D Em C
S: A E F#m D

Looking around the house.
Hidden behind the window and the door.
Searching for signs of life but there's nobody home.

Well, maybe I'm just too sure.
Or maybe I'm just too frightened by the sound of it.
Pieces of note fall down, but the letter said

  Aha, it was good living with you.

Sitting around the house
Watching the sun trace shadows on the floor.
Searching for signs of life, but there's nobody home.

Well maybe I'll call or write you a letter.
Now maybe we'll see on the fourth of July.
But I'm not too sure and I'm not too proud.
Well I'm not too sure and I'm not too proud to say.

c!

Solo
