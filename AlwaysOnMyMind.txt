Maybe I didn't treat you quite as good as I should
Maybe I didn't love you quite as often as I could
Little things I should've said and done, I never took  the time
You were always on my mind..

Maybe I didn't hold you all those lonely, lonely times
And I guess I never told you, I'm so happy that you're mine
If I made you feel second best, I'm so sorry, I was blind
You were always on my mind You were always on my mind

Tell me,  tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give me   one more chance to keep you satisfied Satisfied
