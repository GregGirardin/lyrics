Fame

Fame, makes a man take things over
Fame, lets him loose, hard to swallow
Fame, puts you there where things are hollow

  Fame, it's not your brain, it's just the flame
  That burns your change to keep you insane

.. what you like is in the limo
.. what you get is no tomorrow
.. what you need you have to borrow

Fame, "Nein! It's mine!" is just his line
To bind your time, it drives you to crime

  Could it be the best, could it be?
  Really be, really, babe?
  Could it be, my babe, could it, babe?
  Could it, babe? Could it, babe?

Is it any wonder I reject you first? Fame...
Is it any wonder you are too cool to fool

  Fame, bully for you, chilly for me
  Got to get a rain check on pain

Fame
What's your name?
