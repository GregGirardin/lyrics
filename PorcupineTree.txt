I was pretending to be floating strong but I was sinking into still water
Eyes closed all of the rest will flow
Then out of darkness I found I could still feel something good out of the woods
Eyes closed all of the rest will flow

  I know.. I know the rest will flow

One simple thing that I never could see but now I know
All of the rest will flow
Stay with me my angel I found you now I don't feel low
All of the rest will flow
Eyes closed all of the rest will flow

  I know.. I know the rest will flow

If you fall asleep with me you can dream and drowse the minutes turn to hours
We could climb a tree or two and watch the sun go down upon our sleepy town
After all the time I spent with you summer went away and we just weren't the same
It's just you and me alone not grown up but not kids you kissed me on the lips
