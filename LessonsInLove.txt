Lessons In Love

I'm not proud I was wrong and the truth is hard to take
I felt sure we had enough but our love went overboard
Lifeboat lies lost at sea I've been trying to reach your shore
Waves of doubt keep drowning me

  All the dreams that we were building, we never fulfilled them
  Could be better, should be better, for lessons in love

For restless eyes egos burn and the mold is hard to break
Now we've waded in too deep and love is overboard
Heavy hearts token words all the hopes I ever had
Fade like footprints in the sand

  All the homes that we were building we never lived in
  Could be better, should be better lessons in love
  If we lose the time before us the future will ignore us
  We should use it, we could use it, yeah, Lessons in love

  Lost without love

    Lessons in love
      When will you ever learn
      When there's nowhere left to turn
      Don't let your spirit burn
      I'll wait till you return

  All the dreams that we were building we never lived them
  We could lose it, we should use it lessons in love
  All the homes that we were building we never lived in
  Could be better, should be better lessons in love
  If we lose the time before us the future will ignore us
  We should use it, we could use it lessons in love
