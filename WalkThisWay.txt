Backstroke lover always hidin’ ‘neath the cover, Still I talked to your daddy he say,
He said you ain’t seen nothing ‘Til you’re down on a muffin, then you’re sure to be a-changin’ your ways.
I met a cheerleader, was a real young bleeder, All the times I can reminisce,
‘Cause the best thing lovin’ With her sister and her cousin only started with a little kiss, like this!

See-saw swingin’ with the boys in the school and your feet flyin’ up in the air,
So I took a big chance at the high school dance with a missy who was ready to play
Was it me she was foolin’ ‘Cause she knew what she was doin’ and I know love was here to stay
When she told me to

  Walk this way.. Ah, just give me a kiss - Like this!

School girl Sadie with the classy, Kinda sassy, Little skirt climbing way up her knees,
There was three young ladies in the ground gym locker when I noticed they was lookin’ at me.
I was a high school loser Never made it with a lady till the boys told me something I missed,
Then my next door neighbour with a daughter had a favour, So I gave her just a little kiss, like this!

see-saw swingin’ with the boys in the school, and your feet flyin’ up in the air,
Singin’ hey diddle-diddle with the kitty in the middle, tou be swingin’ like you just didn’t care.
So I took a big chance at the high school dance With a missy who was ready to play.
Was it me she was foolin’, ‘Cause she knew what she was doin’, when she told me how to walk this way.

She told me to

  Walk this way..
