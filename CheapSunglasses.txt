When you get up in the morning and the light is hurt'n your head
The first thing you do when you get up out of bed
Is hit that street a-runnin' and try to meet the masses
And go get yourself some cheap sunglasses
Oh yeah

I spot a little thing and I followed her all night
In a funky pair of levis and her sweater's kind of tight
She had a west coast strut that was as sweet as molases
But what really knocked me out was her cheap sunglasses
Oh yeah

Solo

Now go out and get yourself some big black frames
With the glass so dark thay won't even know your name
And the choice is up to you cause they come in two classes
Rhinestone shades and cheap sunglasses
Oh yeah
