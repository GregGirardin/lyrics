Doctor, my eyes have seen the years
And the slow parade of fears without crying
Now I want to understand
I have done all that I could, to see the evil and the good
without hiding.  You must help me if you can

  Doctor, my eyes, tell me what is wrong
  Was I unwise to leave them open for so long

'Cause I have wandered through this world
And as each moment has unfurled, I've been waiting to awaken from these dreams
People go just where they will, I never noticed them until
I got this feeling, that it's later than it seems

  Doctor, my eyes, tell me what you see
  I hear their cries, just say if it's too late for me

  Doctor, my eyes, they cannot see the sky
  Is this the price for having learned how not to cry
