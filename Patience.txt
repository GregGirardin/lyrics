Patience

Shed a tear cause I'm missing you I'm still alright to smile
Girl I think about you every day now
Was a time when I wasn't sure but you set my mind at ease
There is no doubt, you're in my heart now

Said woman, take it slow it'll work itself out fine
All we need is just a little patience
Said sugar, make it slow and it'll come together fine
All we need is just a little patience

I sit here on the stairs cause I'd rather be alone
If I can't have you right now I'll wait, dear
Sometimes I get so tense but I can't speed up the time
But you know love, there's one more thing to consider

Said woman, take it slow nd things will be just fine
You and I’ll just use a little patience
Said sugar, take the time cause the lights are shining bright
You and I've got what it takes to make it
We won't fake it Ahh, I'll never break it
Cause I can't take it

A little patience

Need a little patience Yeah

I've been walking the streets tonight
Just trying to get it right
It's hard to see with so many around
You know I don’t like being stuck in the crowd
And the streets don't change but maybe the names
I ain't got time for the game
Cause I need you, yeah yeah, well I need you
