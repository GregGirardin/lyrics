Symphony Of Destruction

You take a mortal man and put him in control
Watch him become a god watch people's heads a-roll

  Just like the Pied Piper, led rats through the streets
  We dance like marionettes, swaying to the Symphony of Destruction

Acting like a robot its metal brain corrodes
You try to take its pulse before the head explodes
Explodes...

Chorus
Solo

The earth starts to rumble world powers fall
A-warring for the heavens a peaceful man stands tall

Chorus
