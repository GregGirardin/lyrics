Your Love

I: E C#m B
O: C#m  A    B

Josie's on a vacation far away come around and talk it over
So many things that I wanna to say you know I like my girls a little bit older
 
  I just wanna use your love tonight
  I don't wanna lose your love tonight
 
I ain't got many friends left to talk to
No-one's around when I'm in trouble
You know I'd do anything for you
Stay the night, we'll keep it under cover
 
  I just wanna use your love tonight
  I don't wanna lose your love tonight
 
G A x4
 
    Try to stop my hands from shakin Somethin' in my mind's not makin' sense
    It's been a while since we've been all alone I can't hide the way I'm feelin'
 
As you leave me please would you close the door and don't forget what I told you
Just 'cause you're right, that don't mean I'm wrong another shoulder to cry upon
 
[Chorus]
 
[Outro]
Lose your love
