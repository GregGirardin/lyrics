Josie's on a vacation far away come around and talk it over
So many things that I wanna to say you know I like my girls a little bit older
 
  I just wanna use your love tonight
  I don't wanna lose your love tonight
 
I ain't got many friends left to talk to
No-one's around when I'm in trouble
You know I'd do anything for you
Stay the night, we'll keep it under cover
 
 Chorus
 
    Try to stop my hands from shakin somethin in my mind's not makin' sense
    It's been a while since we've been all alone I can't hide the way I'm feelin'
 
As you leave me please would you close the door and don't forget what I told you
Just 'cause you're right, that don't mean I'm wrong another shoulder to cry upon
 
Chorus
 
Lose your love
