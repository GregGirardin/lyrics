She comes down from Yellow Mountain on a dark, flat land she rides
On a pony she named Wildfire whirlwind by her side
On a cold Nebraska night.

Oh, they say she died one winter when there came an early frost
And the pony she named Wildfire busted down its stall,
In a blizzard she was lost.

  She ran calling Wildfire...

So by the dark of the moon I planted but there came an early snow.
Been a hoot owl howlin' outside my window now about six nights in a row.
She's coming for me, I know and on Wildfire, we're both gonna go.

  We'll be riding Wildfire..
