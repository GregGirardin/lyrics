  Any way you want it
  That's the way you need it any way you want it
 
She loves to laugh she loves to sing she does everything
She loves to move she loves to groove she loves the lovin' things
Ooh, all night, all night oh every night
So hold tight, hold tight ooh, baby, hold tight Oh, she said,
 
Chorus
 
I was alone I never knew what good love could do
Ooh, then we touched then we sang about the lovin' things
Ooh all night...
