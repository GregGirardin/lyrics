Voodoo Child

Well, I stand up next to a mountain chop it down with the edge of my hand x 2
Well, i pick up all the pieces and make an island might even raise a little sand
'Cause I'm a voodoo child lord knows i'm a voodoo child

I didn't mean to take up all your sweet time, give it back to ya one of these days
If i don't meet you no more in this world then uh
I'll meet ya on the next one and don't be late
Don't be late

'Cause I'm a voodoo child lord knows i'm a voodoo child baby
