  Hah...

So true funny how it seems always in time
but never in line for dreams
Head over heels when toe to toe
This is the sound of my soul this is the sound

  I bought a ticket to the world
  but now I've come back again
  why do I find it hard to write the next line
  when I want the truth to be said..

  haa... I know this much is true

With a thrill in my head an a pill on my tongue
Dissolve the nerves that have just begun
Listening to Marvin all night long
This is the sound of my soul, this is the sound

  Always slipping from my hands
  Sand's a time of it's own
  Take your seaside arms and write the next line
  Oh I want the truth to be known

Chorus

Solo
