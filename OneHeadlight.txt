One Headlight

V: G D F# Bm A
C: G D Em A

So long ago, I don't remember when
That's when they say I lost my only friend
Well since she died easy of a broken heart disease
As I listened through the cemetery trees

I seen the sun comin' up at the funeral at dawn
The long broken arm of human law
Now it always seemed such a waste She always had a pretty face
So I wondered why she hung around this place

  Hey, come on try a little nothing is forever
  There's got to be something better than in the middle
  But me and Cinderella we put all together
  We can drive it home with one headlight

She said it's cold it feels like independence day
And I can't break away from this parade
But There's got to be an opening somewhere here in front of me
Through this maze of ugliness and greed

And I seen the sun up ahead at the county line bridge
Sayin' all there's good and nothingness is dead
We'll run until she's out of breath she ran until there's nothin' left
She hit the end-it's just her window ledge

!Chorus

Well this place is old It feels just like a beat up truck
I turn the engine, But the engine doesn't turn
Well it smells of cheap wine and cigarettes this place is always such a mess
Sometimes I think I'd like to watch it burn

I'm so alone, and I feel just like somebody else
Man i ain't changed, but i know I ain't the same
But somewhere here in between the city walls of dyin' dreams
I think her death it must be killin' me

!Chorus
