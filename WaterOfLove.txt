Water of Love 

I: D C G  Am C - D C G D
V: D D Am D
C: (Am G D)

High and dry in the long hot day. Lost and lonely in every way.
Got the flats all around, sky up above. Yes I need a little water of love.

I've been too long lonely and my heart feels pain. Crying out for some soothing rain.
I believe I've taken enough. Yes I need a little water of love.

  Water of love deep in the ground but there ain't no water here to be found.
  Some day baby when the river runs free it's gonna carry that water of love to me.

Intro

There's a bird up in a tree sitting up high. Just awaitin for me to die.
If I don't get some water soon, I'll be dead and gone in the afternoon.

Chorus

Intro

Once I had a woman I could call my own. Once I had a woman now my woman she gone.
Once there was a river, now there's a stone. You know it's evil when you're living alone.
