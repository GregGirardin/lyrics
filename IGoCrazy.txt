Hello girl it's been a while. Guess you'll be glad to know that I've learned how to laugh and smile
Getting over you was slow. They say old lovers can be good friends
But I never thought I'd really see you again, I'd really see you again

  I go crazy when I look in your eyes I still go crazy
  No my heart just can't hide that old feelin' inside way deep down inside
  Oh baby, you know when I look in your eyes I go crazy

You say he satisfies your mind tells you all of his dreams I know how much that means to you
I realize that I was blind just when I thought I was over you
I see your face and it just ain't true, no it just ain't true
