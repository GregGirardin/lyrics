She's come undone. She didn't know what she was headed for
And when I found what she was headed for, it was too late
She's come undone. She found a mountain that was far too high
And when she found out she couldn't fly it was too late
 
  It's too late. She's gone too far. She's lost the sun
 
She's come undone she wanted truth, but all she got was lies
Came the time to realize and it was too late
She's come undone, she didn't know what she was headed for
And when I found what she was headed for mama, it was too late
 
  It's too late, she's gone too far, she's lost the sun
  She's come undone No-na-na, no-na-na, no-na-na
 
    Too many mountains and not enough stairs to climb
    Too many churches and not enough truth
    Too many people and not enough eyes to see
    Too many lives to lead and not enough time
 
  It's too late she's gone too far she's lost the sun She's come undone
