There's a black man with a black cat livin in a black neighborhood
He's got a interstate runin' through his front yard you know he thinks he's got it so good
There's a woman in the kitchen cleanin' up the evenin' slop
And he looks at her and says hey darlin I remember when you could stop a clock

  Oh but ain't America for you and me Ain't that America
  Somethin' to see baby Ain't that America home of the free
  Little pink houses for you and me

There's a young man in a t-shirt listnin' to a rock n' roll station
He's got greasy hair  greasy smile he says Lord this must be my destination
Cuz they told me when i was younger said boy you're gonna be president
Just like everything else those old dreams kinda went away

Chorus

Well there's people and more people but do they no,no,no
Go to work in the summer and vacation down at the Gulf of Mexico
And there's winners and there's losers thinkin' no big deal cuz the simple man baby
Pays the thrills the bills the bills that kill

Chorus
