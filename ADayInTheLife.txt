I read the news today oh boy about a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph

He blew his mind out in a car he didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared they'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords

I saw a film today oh boy the English army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away but I just had to look
Having read the book. I'd love to turn you on

  Woke up, fell out of bed, dragged a comb across my head
  Found my way downstairs and drank a cup and looking up, I noticed I was late
  Found my coat and grabbed my hat, made the bus in seconds flat
  Found my way upstairs and had a smoke and somebody spoke and I went into a dream
  Ahhh..

I read the news today oh boy four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small they had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
I'd love to turn you on
