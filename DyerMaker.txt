C: (Am G) F G

Oh, you don't have to go x 3
Ah.. all those tears I cried x 2
Oh-oh, ah-aye, baby please don't go

   When I read the letter you wrote me it made me mad..
   When I read the words that it told me it made me sad...
   But I still love you so, I can't let you go
   I love you... Ooh, baby I love you

Oh, every breath I take, every move I make hey, ooh baby please don't go
Ah it hurts me to my soul, you hurt me to my soul, ooh, darling please don't go

Chorus / Solo

Oh.. you don't have to go.. baby, please,
Oh-oh. I really love you baby Ooh-ooh, darling
Oh baby I still love you so
