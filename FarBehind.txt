Far Behind

Now maybe I didn't mean to treat you bad but I did it anyway
And then maybe some would say your life was sad but you lived it anyway
And so maybe your friends they stand around they watch you crumble
 as you falter down to the ground
And then someday your friends they stand beside as you were flying
  oh you were flying oh so high

But then someday people look at you for what they call their own they watch you suffer
Yeah they hear you calling home
And then some day we could take our time to brush the leaves aside so you can reach us
But you left me far behind

  Now maybe I didn't mean to treat you oh so bad but I did it anyway
  Now maybe some would say you're left with what you had but you couldn't share the pain

No, no, no couldn't share the pain, they watch you suffer
Now maybe I could have made my own mistakes but I live with what I've known
And then maybe we might share in something rare but won't you look at where we've grown
  won't you look at where we've gone
But then someday comes tomorrow holds a sense of what I feel for you in my mind
  as you trip the final line
And that cold day when you lost control shame you left my life so soon
  you should have told me but you left me far behind

Chorus

Solo

    Oh no

Chorus

I said times have changed your friends they come and watch you crumble to the ground They watch you suffer
Yeah, they hold you down gold you down
Now maybe oh oh, maybe I didn't mean to treat you bad
But you left me far behind
