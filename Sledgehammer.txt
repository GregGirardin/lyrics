Hey use it, everybody use it!
You could have a steam train if you'd just lay down your tracks.
You could have an aeroplane flying if you bring your blue sky back.
All you do is call me I'll be anything you need.

You could have a big dipper, going up and down around the bends.
You could have a bumper car bumping this amusement never ends.

  I wanna be your sledgehammer, why don't you call my name?
  Oh let me be your sledgehammer, this will be my testimony.

Show me round your fruitcage cause I will be your honey bee.
Open up your fruitcage where the fruit is as sweet as can be.

  I wanna be your sledgehammer, why don't you call my name?
  You'd better call the sledgehammer put your mind at rest.
  I'm going to be the sledgehammer this can be my testimony.
  I'm your sledgehammer let there be no doubt about it.

I get it right
I've kicked the habit, shed my skin
This is the new stuff, I go dancing in
Won't you show for me, I will show for you

!Solo

Won't you show for me, I will show for you

I've been feeding the rhythm
Come on come on help me through.
