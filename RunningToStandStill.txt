Running To Stand Still

V: (D G)
C: (A G) D

So she woke up, woke up from
Where she was, lyin' still, and said
"I've got to do something about where we're goin'.
Step on a steam train, step out of the driving rain maybe,
run from the darkness in the night."

  Singing "La la la la de dei"...

Sweet the sin, bitter the taste in my mouth.
I see seven towers, but I only see one way out.
You gotta cry without weeping, talk without speaking scream without raising your voice.
You know I took the poison, from the poison stream
Then I floated out of here.

  Chorus

She runs through the streets, with her eyes painted red
Under a black belly of cloud in the rain.
In through a doorway she brings me white golden pearls stolen from the sea.
She is ragin', she is raging and the storm blows up in her eyes.
She will suffer the needle chill. She's running to stand still.
