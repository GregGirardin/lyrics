Teardrop

V: (A4 G6s2 D2 A7) FM7 G6 A4

Love, love is a verb, love is a doing word - fearless on my breath
Gentle impulsion, shakes me, makes me lighter..
Teardrop on the fire...

Night, night, after day, black flowers blossom...
Black flowers blossom...
Teardrop on the fire...

Water is my eye, most faithful mirror...
Teardrop on the fire over confession...
Most faithful mirror...
Teardrop on the fire..

You're stumbling in the dark
