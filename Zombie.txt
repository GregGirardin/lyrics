Zombie

Em C G D/F#

Another head hangs lowly child is slowly taken
The violence caused such silence who are we mistaken
But you see it's not me, it's not my family
In your head, in your head, they are fighting
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns
in your head, in your head, they are crying

  In your head.. zombie
  What's in your head.. zombie

Another mother's breaking heart is taking over
When the violence causes silence we must be mistaken
It's the same old theme since 1916
In your head...

!Chorus
