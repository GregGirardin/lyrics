Free

C F - C Dm Em F

So we live out in our old van travel all across this land me and you
And we'll end up hand in hand somewhere down on the sand just me and you

  Just as free, free as we'll ever be

We drive until the city lights dissolve into a country sky just me and you
Lay underneath the harvest moon do all the things that lovers do just me and you

Chorus

!Harmonica C

No we don't have a lot of money... all we need is love

Chorus

So we live out in our old van travel all across this land me and you
