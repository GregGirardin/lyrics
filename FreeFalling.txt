Free Falling

E A - A E B

She's a good girl loves her mama, loves Jesus and America too
She's a good girl crazy bout Elvis, loves horses and her boyfriend too
 
It's a long day livin in Reseda. There's a freeway runnin through the yard
And I'm a bad boy, cause I don't even miss her. I'm a bad boy for breakin her heart
 
  Now I'm free, free fallin...
 
All the vampires walkin through the valley move west down Ventura Boulevard
All the bad boys are standing in the shadows and the good girls are home with broken hearts
 
!Chorus

  Free fallin now I'm free fallin now I'm

Break w/ "Free fallin now I'm free fallin now I'm"

I wanna glide down (ohh ehh) over Mulholland I wanna write her (ohh ehh) name in the sky 
Gonna free fall (ohh ehh) out into nothin gonna leave this (ohh ehh) world for a while

Chorus w/ "Free fallin now I'm free fallin now I'm"

!Instrumental

!Chorus
