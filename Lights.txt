Lights

C: (D Bm C) Bm C D
B: (Bm G D) A Bm - G D

  When the lights go down in the city
  And the sun shines on the bay
  Do I want to be there in my city, oh-oh

So you think you're lonely
Well my friend I'm lonely too
I want to get back to my City by the bay

It's sad, oh, there's been mornings out on the road without you,
Without your charms, Ooh, my.. Ooh, ooh  oooh

Chorus

Bm G D D  Bm G D A  Bm G D D  Bm C D Dsus2 D
