  Diamond girl, you sure do shine
  Glad I found you, glad you're mine

Oh, my love, you're like a precious stone
Part of earth, where heaven has rained on
Makes no difference where you are
Day or night time you're like a shining star

How could I, I shine without you
When it's about you that I am, woah oh, oh oh

  Diamond girl, roaming wild
  Such a rare thing, radiant child

I could never find another one like you
Part of me is deep down inside you
Can't you feel the whole world's a-turnin'
We are real we are burnin'
Diamond girl now that I've found you
Well, it's around you that I am, woah oh

Solo

Diamond girl you sure do shine..
