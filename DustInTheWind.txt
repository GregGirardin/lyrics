I close my eyes only for a moment and a moment´s gone.
All my dreams pass before my eyes a curiosity.
 
  Dust in the wind, all we are is dust in the wind.
 
Same old song, just a drop of water in the endless sea.
All we do, crumbles to the ground though we refuse to see.
 
  Dust in the wind, all we are is dust in the wind.

Solo

Don't hang on, nothing lasts forever but the earth and sky.
It slips a-way all your money won´t another minute buy.
 
  Dust in the wind, all we are is dust in the wind.
  Dust in the wind, everything is dust in the wind.
