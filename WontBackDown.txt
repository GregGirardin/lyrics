Won't Back Down
 
V: (Em D G) Em D C Em D G
C: C G (C G D G) (Em D G)

Well I won't back down. No I won't back down,
You can stand me up at the gates of hell but I won't back down
 
No, I stand my ground won't be turned around
And I'll keep this world from draggin me down
Gonna stand my ground and I won't back down
 
  Hey baby, there ain't no easy way out.
  Hey I, will stand my ground and I won't back down.
 
Well I know what's right, I got just one life
In a world that keeps on pushin me around but I stand my ground
and I won't back down
