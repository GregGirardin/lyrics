Let's go

I: A G G A
V: (A D) G A 
P: E D C
C: A D

She's driving away with the dim lights on
She's making her play and she can't go wrong
She never waits too long

She's winding them down on her clock machine
And she won't give up cause she's seventeen
She's a frozen fire she's my one desire
 
  I don't want to hold her down
  Don't want to break her crown
  When she says
 
  Let's go
  I like the nightlife baby - She says
  I like the nightlife baby
  She says - Let's go!
 
She's laughing inside cause they can't refuse
She's so beautiful now she doesn't wear her shoes
She never likes to choose
She's got wonderful eyes 

And a risqué mouth and when I asked her before
She said she's holding out
She's a frozen fire
She's my one desire

Chorus
