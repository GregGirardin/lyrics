Dear Mr Fantasy

E D A E, (C#m E) D B7

Dear Mister Fantasy play us a tune
Something to make us all happy
Do anything take us out of this gloom
Sing a song, play guitar, make it snappy

You are the one who can make us all laugh
but doing that you break out in tears
Please don't be sad if it was a straight mind you had
We wouldn't have known you all these years
