Brick House

  She's a brick house she's mighty, mighty just lettin' it all hang out
  She's a brick house I like ladies stacked and that's a fact ain't holding nothing back
  She's a brick house well we're together everybody knows this is how the story goes

She knows she's got everything that a woman needs to get a man
How can she lose with the stuff she use? 36-24-36, what a winning hand

!Chorus (w/ She's the one, the only one built like an Amazon)

The clothes she wear, her sexy ways make a old man wish for younger days
She knows she's built and knows how to please sure enough can knock a strong man to his knees

!Chorus

Shake it down, shake it down now
