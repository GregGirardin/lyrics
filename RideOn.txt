It's another lonely evenin, in another lonely town
But I ain't too young to worry, and I ain't too old to cry when a woman gets me down

Got another empty bottle and another empty bed
Ain't too young to admit it and I'm not too old to lie I'm just another empty head

  That's why I'm lonely, I'm so lonely but I know what I'm gonna do
  I'm gonna ride on
    Standing on the edge of the road, thumb in the air
    one of these days I'm gonna, change my evil ways
    Till then I'll just keep ridin' on

!Solo

Broke another promise, and I broke another heart
But I ain't too young to realize that I ain't too old to try, try to get back to the start

And it's another red light nightmare, another red light street
And I ain't too old to hurry cause I ain't too old to die, but I sure am hard to beat

  But I'm lonely, lord I'm lonely, what am I gonna do. Ride on
    Got myself a one-way ticket, going the wrong way
    gonna change my evil ways, one of these days

!Solo

  I'm gonna ride on, looking for a truck
  Hmmmm, keep on riding, Riding on and on
  gonna have myself a good time.. yeah yeah...  one of these days
