Dreams

V: (F G)
C: (FM7 G6)

Now here you go again you say you want your freedom well who am I to keep you down?
It's only right that you should play the way you feel it
But listen carefully to the sound
Of your loneliness, like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost, and what you had, and what you lost

  Oh thunder only happens when it's raining
  Players only love you when they're playing
  Women they will come and they will go
  When the rain washes you clean you'll know, you'll know

Solo

Now here I go again I see your crystal visions, I keep my visions to myself
It's only me who wants to wrap around you dreams and
Have you any dreams you'd like to sell
Dreams of loneliness like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost, and what you had, ooh what you lost

Chorus x 2
