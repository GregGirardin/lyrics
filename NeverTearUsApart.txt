Never Tear Us Apart

Am F Dm F - (C F) G

Don't ask me, what you know is true
Don't have to tell you, I love your precious heart

  I was standing you were there
  Two worlds collided and they could never tear us apart

We could live for a thousand years
But if I hurt you I'd make wine from your tears
I told you that we could fly
Cause we all have wings but some of us don't know why

!Chorus

!Harmonica C
