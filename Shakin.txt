Shakin

V: A B  D
C: A B G A

Roseanna's dady had a car she loved to drive,
Stole the keys one night and took me for a ride.
Turned up the music just as loud as it could go,
Blew out the speakers in her daddy's radio.
 
  She was shakin' (oh) Snappin her fingers
  She was moving round and round. That girl was shakin
 
We started drinkin' want to take it straight
She was doin' 80 and she slammed on the brakes.
We got so high we had to pull to the side,
We did some shakin' till the middle of the night!
 
Chorus
 
Solo
 
  I got a little nervous, huh..
  She took her coat off,
  She looked so pretty,
  Awwww, yeah!

I'm always talkin' baby, talkin' too much,
I love that little girl and I just can't get enough!
It takes a lonely night with nowhere to go,
Just call Roseanna it's a hell of a show!
 
Chorus
