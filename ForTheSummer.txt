For the Summer

I: B F#m A  V: B F#m A E   C: (A E) B F#m E D   O: (B F#m) E D B

Rollin' through these hills I've known I'd be coming
There ain't a man alive that likes to be alone
It's been a while since I seen my lady smile
Have I been have I been away so long

  I'm tired..
  Can I come home for the summer I could slow down for a little while
  Get back to lovin each other leave all those long and lonesome miles behind

Through the years I have learned some things worth the tellin
And you'd be right in guessin that each and every lesson they were hard won

!Chorus / Harmonica E

You'll follow her, wherever she goes
You love her, and you just wanted to know
That you'll follow her, you'll find a way
Cause you love her and you just wanted to know
