Red Skies

(Em D G A Em) - A

Red skies at night, Oh oh
Should have taken warning, it was just people mourning
Running, hiding, lost couldn't find, find a place to go
So it's red skies at night Oh oh

  Someone's taking over and it looks like they're aiming
  Right at you and me and everybody everybody
  Someone says we could be dead by morning
  Someone cries, oh, leaving

Red eyes at night Oh oh..
Red skies at night
Oh oh, whoa oh oh

A
Em

Red skies at night oh oh...
