Melt With You

C F

Moving forward using all my breath
Making love to you was never second best
I saw the world crashing all around your face
Never really knowing it was always mesh and lace

  I’ll stop the world and melt with you
  You’ve seen the difference and it’s getting better all the time
  There’s nothing you and I won’t do
  I’ll stop the world and melt with you

Dream of better lives the kind which never hate
Trapped in the state of imaginary grace
I made a pilgrimage to save this humans race
What I’m comprehending a race that long gone bye

!Chorus

Em G Am C

The future’s open wide

!Solo

!Chorus

The future’s open wide

Hmmm hmmm hmmm
