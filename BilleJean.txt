Billie Jean

She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round?

She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene.
Then ev'ry head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one,
Who will dance on the floor in the round

  People always told me, be careful what you do.
  And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
  And mother always told me, be careful who you love,
  And be careful what you do, cause the lie becomes the truth, hey

    Billie Jean is not my lover
    She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
    But the kid is not my son
    She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

For forty days and forty nights, law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand, her schemes and plans
Cause we danced on the floor in the round.
So take my strong advice: Just remember to always think twice

She told my baby we danced till three, and she looked at me
Then showed a photo. My baby cried. His eyes were like mine.
Can we dance on the floor in the round?

  People always told me, be careful what you do.
  And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
  But you came and stood right by me, just a smell of sweet perfume.
  This happened much too soon. She called me to her room, hey

  !Chorus
