There's a storm across the valley, clouds are rolling in;
the afternoon is heavy on your shoulders
There's a truck out on the four lane, a mile or more away;
the whining of his wheels just makes it colder

He's an hour away from riding, on your prayers up in the sky;
and ten days on the road are barely gone
There's a fire softly burning, supper's on the stove;
but it's the light in your eyes that makes him warm

  Hey, it's good to be back home again
  Sometimes, this old farm, feels like a long lost friend,
  yes, and hey it's good to be back home again

There's all the news to tell him, howâ€™d you spend your time;
and what's the latest thing the neighbors say?
And your mother called last Friday, Sunshine made her cry;
and you felt the baby move just yesterday

Chorus

    And oh, the time that I can lay this tired old body down
    and feel your fingers feather soft upon me
    The kisses that I live for, the love that lights my way
    the happiness that living with you brings me

It's the sweetest thing I know of, just spending time with you;
it's the little things that make a house a home
Like a fire softly burning, and supper on the stove;
and the light in your eyes that makes me warm

Chorus
