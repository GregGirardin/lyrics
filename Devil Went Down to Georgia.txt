The Devil went down to Georgia he was looking for a soul to steal
He was in a bind cause he was way behind he was willin' to make a deal
When he came across this young man sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot
And the Devil jumped upon a hickory stump
                                 A C Dm
and said boy let me tell you what
 
I guess you didn't know it but I'm a fiddle player too
And if you'd care to take a dare I'll make a bet with you
Now you play a pretty good fiddle boy but give the devil his due
I bet a fiddle of gold against your soul cause I think I'm better than you 
The boy said my name's Johnny and it might be a sin
But I'll take your bet, you're gonna regret cause I'm the best that's ever been
 
Dm
Johnny, you rosin up your bow
    C
and play your fiddle hard
      Gm
Cause hellâ€™s broke loose in Georgia
        Dm
and the Devil deals it hard
    Dm                            Gm
And if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold
    A                               A G F E
But if you lose the Devil gets your soul

The Devil opened up his case and he said I'll start this show
And fire flew from his fingertips as he rosined up his bow
And he pulled the bow across his strings and it made an evil hiss
Then a band of demons joined in and it sounded something like this

When the Devil finished Johnny said well, you're pretty good ol' son
But sit down in that chair right there and let me show you how it's done

    Fire on the mountain, run boys run
    C
    The Devil's in the house of the risin' sun
    Chicken in the bread pan pickin' out dough
    Granny does your dog bite no, child, no

The Devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat
and he laid that golden fiddle on the ground at Johnny's feet
Johnny said Devil just come on back if you ever wanna try again
I done told you once, you son of a bitch I'm the best that's ever been, and he played
 
    Fire on the mountain, run boys run
    The Devil's in the house of the risin' sun
    The chicken in the bread pan are pickin' out dough
    Granny will your dog bite no, child, no
