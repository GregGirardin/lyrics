C: D C Am   B: Am G F

Lookin' for to save my, save my soul
Lookin' in the places where no flowers grow
Lookin' for to fill that God-shaped hole
Mother, mother-suckin' rock and roll

Holy dunc, space junk comin' in for the splash
White dopes on punk staring into the flash
Lookin' for the baby Jesus under the trash

Mother, mother-suckin' rock an' roll x 2
Mother...

  Mother, am I still your son?
  You know I've waited for so long to hear you say so
  Mother, you left and made me someone
  Now I'm still a child, but no one tells me no

Lookin' for a sound that's gonna drown out the world
Lookin' for the father of my two little girls
Got the swing, got the sway, got my straw in lemonade
Still lookin' for the face I had before the world was made

Chorus

Soothe me mother, Rule me father, Move me brother, Woo me sister
