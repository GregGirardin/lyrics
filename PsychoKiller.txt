I cant seem to face up to the facts
I'm tense and nervous and I cant relax
I cant sleep cause my beds on fire
Don't touch me I'm a real live wire

  Psycho killer qu'est que c'est fa fa.. far better
  Run run... away.. oh yeah..

You start a conversation you can't even finish it
You're talking a lot, but you're not saying anything
When I have nothing to say, my lips are sealed
Say something once, why say it again?

Chorus

  Ce que j'ai fais ce soir la
  Ce qu' elle a dit ce soir la
  Realisant mon espoir je me lance vers la gloire okay

We are vain and we are blind
I hate people when they're not polite

Chorus

<i>Alternate V2
I passed out hours ago
I'm sadder than you'll ever know
I close my eyes on this sunny day
Say something once, why say it again?
