Take Me Out

So if you're lonely you know I'm here waiting for you
I'm just a crosshair I'm just a shot away from you
And if you leave here, you leave me broken, shattered, I lie
I'm just a crosshair I'm just a shot, then we can die

I know I won't be leaving here with you

I say don't you know you say you don't know I say take me out!
I say you don't show don't move, time is slow...
I say you don't know you say you don't know...

If I move this could die if eyes move this could die
I want you...to take me out!

  I know I won't be leaving here (with you) x 4

I say don't you know? You say you don't know
I say take me out
If I wane, this could die I wait, this could die
I want you to take me out
If I move, this could die eyes move, this can die
Come on, take me out

I know I won't be leaving here...
