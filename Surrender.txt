Surrender

Oh the city's alight with lovers and lies bright blue eyes
The city is bright It's brighter than day tonight

  Surrender, surrender

Sadie said she couldn't work out What it was all about so she let go.
Now Sadie's on the street and the people she meets you know
She tried to be a good girl and a good wife
Raise a good family, lead a good life it's not good enough
She got herself up on the 48th floor
Got to find out, find out, what she's living for

Chorus

Solo

Tonight

Oh the city's a fire a passionate flame knows me by name
The city's desire to take me for more and more
It's in the street getting under my feet
It's in the air, it's everywhere I look for you
It's in the things I do and say and if I want to live
I've got to die to myself someday

Oh..

Sing my, sing my, sing my song

Chorus
