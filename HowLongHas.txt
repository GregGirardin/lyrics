How Long Has This Been Going on

  How long has this been goin' on

Oh your friends with their fancy persuasion don't admit that it's part of a scheme
But I can't help but have my suspicions cause I ain't quite as dumb as I seem
And you said you was never intending to break up our singing this way
But there ain't any use in pretending it could happen to us any day

!Chorus
