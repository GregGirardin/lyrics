The Captain Of Her Heart

It was way past midnight and she still couldn't fall asleep
This night the dream was leaving she tried so hard to keep
And with the new day's dawning she felt it drifting away
Not only for a cruise not only for a day

Too long ago too long apart
She couldn't wait another day for the captain of her heart
As the day came up she made a stop
She stopped waiting another day for the captain of her heart
