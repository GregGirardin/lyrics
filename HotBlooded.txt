  Well, I'm hot blooded, check it and see
  I got a fever of a hundred and three
  Come on baby, do you do more than dance?
  I'm hot blooded, I'm hot blooded

You don't have to read my mind to know what I have in mind
Honey you oughta know,
Now you move so fine, let me lay it on the line
I wanna know what you're doin' after the show
 
  Now it's up to you, we can make a secret rendezvous
  Just me and you, I'll show you lovin' like you never knew

Chorus
 
If it feels alright, maybe you can stay all night
Should I leave you my key?
But you've got to give me a sign, come on girl, some kind of sign
Tell me, are you hot mama? You sure look that way to me
 
  Are you old enough? will you be ready when I call your bluff?
  Is my timing right? did you save your love for me tonight?

Chorus
 
Solo

  Now it's up to you, can we make a secret rendezvous?
  Oh, before we do, you'll have to get away from you know who

Chorus 
 
  every night.. you're looking so tight.. now you're driving me wild
  I'm so hot for you child..
  I'm a little bit high.. you're a little bit shy.. you're making me sing
  for your sweet sweet thing
