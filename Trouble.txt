Trouble.. been wronging my soul since the day I was born
Worry.. just will not seem to leave my mind alone

  I've been saved by a woman... she won't let me go

Trouble.. feels like every time I get back on my feet
  she come around and knock me down again
Worry.. sometimes I swear it feels like
  this worry is my only friend

Chorus / Harmonica G

Whoa... She good to me now. She give me love and affection.
She good to me
